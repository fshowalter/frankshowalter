Five college kids head out for a weekend in a remote cabin secluded deep in the woods, where one inadvertently unleashes an ancient, supernatural evil. There's wit to spare in Whedon and Goddard's literate horror film deconstruction as it lays bare all the genre's tropes in their logic-defying glory. Their "loving hate letter" to the genre is self-referential _almost_ to the point of parody as it serves up equal parts genuine thrills and acerbic black comedy. This is the "cabin in the woods" movie to end all "cabin in the woods" movies. Which is exactly what Whedon and Goddard want. Or is it?
