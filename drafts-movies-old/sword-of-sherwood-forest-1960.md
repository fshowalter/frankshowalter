Synopsis: Robin Hood (Richard Greene) attempts to foil the Sheriff of Nottingham (Peter Cushing).

After striking gold with Frankenstein and Dracula, Hammer Films tried their hand at starting a Robin Hood franchise.

They should have stuck with the monsters.

Terence Fisher's direction is sound and Peter Cushing makes the best of a part that gives him  nothing to do, but ultimately, Sword of Sherwood Forest fails because Richard Greene is simply not right for the leading role of Robin Hood. He has only marginal charisma, his arm shakes whenever he draws his bow, and he has zero chemistry with his leading lady.

Bottom Line: Watch <a href="/browse/reviews/the-adventures-of-robin-hood-1938/">The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)</a> instead.
