Set in Calcutta, Powell plays a notorious playboy who develops a romance with Kenyon, the wife of Marsh, a doctor more interested in his career than his marriage. Powell's great as a perpetually tipsy cad, and the script doesn't wallow in the usual melodramatic situations, making for a better than expected experience. There's even a massive tracking shot that, if the budget had supported it, would have elevated this to something special. Granted, as-is, the shot's laughably fake, but kudos to Green for trying.
