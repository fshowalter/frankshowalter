Synopsis: A wrestling promoter (Humphrey Bogart) pits his lug of a grappler (Nat Pendleton) against an Ozark mountain man, with an Amazon blacksmith as the prize.

Swing Your Lady is awful. In fact, it may be the worst movie of Humphrey Bogart's career. Yes, worse than <a href="/browse/reviews/the-return-of-doctor-x-1939/">The Return of Doctor X (1939)</a>. That disaster was so bad it was laughable. This disaster is just so bad.

For starters, despite Bogart and Frank McHugh getting top billing, the film revolves around Nat Pendleton's character, and Pendleton is hardly up to the task of carrying the picture. His one-note performance has all the charisma of a boulder, and is about as much fun to watch. It's a double shame, since Bogart and McHugh make a decent pair, but they're both wasted here.

Next, there are the various hillbilly shenanigans that routinely grind the film to a halt, whether it be the impromptu hoedowns, Louise Fazenda wrestling Bogart into crying "Hootie Owl", or the atrocious dialog that feels about as authentic as Bogart's performance. For a film that seems targeted at rural audiences, it's pretty insulting.

Finally, it's amazing that, at only 77-minutes, Swing Your Lady feels twice that length. Yes, that's Ronald Reagan as a sports reporter toward the film's end, and if you made it that far into the film congratulations. Now go warn others not to do the same.
