Wayne leads a squadron of American mercenary pilots fighting the Japanese in China before Americaâ€™s entry into World War II. The film borrows heavily from Howard Hawks' Only Angels Have Wings (1939), right down to dressing Wayne in an ill-advised outfit (in this case a trench coat and pith hat), but in favoring action over characterization it can't escape Hawks' shadow, though the liberal use of blood is a refreshing change from the typical bloodless entries in the genre.
