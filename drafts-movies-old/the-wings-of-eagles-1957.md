Synopsis: The life story of pioneer Navy aviator and Hollywood screenwriter Frank W. “Spig” Wead (John Wayne).

The Wings of Eagles is director John Ford’s biography of his good friend Frank Wead, Navy pilot, and later Hollywood screenwriter of films like <a href="/browse/reviews/china-clipper-1936/">China Clipper (1936)</a>.  Though Ford does a good job with the material, his portrait of Wead is somewhat one-sided, and as a result Wead comes across as more like a character than a real person.

That’s not to say the movie isn’t entertaining.  Wayne is great in the lead and Maureen O’Hara proves once again that she’s the best leading lady the Duke ever had.  Ward Bond even gets in on the fun, playing a Hollywood director who bears more than a passing resemblance to John Ford.

Speaking of Ford, one thing I don’t understand is his decision to film several of Maureen O’Hara’s scenes in ultra-soft or distorted focus.  While I can understand the desire to make her seem younger, the effect is so obvious it detracts from the movie.

Bottom Line: An entertaining, if one-sided, portrait of a one of a kind man.
