Synopsis: A group of British pilots endures tragedy as they fight the Germans in World War I.

The Dawn Patrol (or Flight Commander, as it’s known on TV) is a decent war film, but its really notable for being the first time director Howard Hawks would visit the themes that would become so closely associated with him in films like Only Angels Have Wings (1939), Air Force (1943), <a href="/browse/reviews/rio-bravo-1959/">Rio Bravo (1959)</a>, and <a href="/browse/reviews/rio-lobo-1970/">Rio Lobo (1970)</a>.

The performances are all fine, if a bit overstated.  And by the way, that’s Commissioner Gordon from the 1960’s Batman show as Major Brand.

While some of the action sequences are a bit weak by today’s standards, the special effects and aerial photography hold up quite well.  Unfortunately the movie’s strength lies in the characters, not the action, and cutting some of the latter to make room for more of the former would have gone a long way toward making a better movie.

Bottom Line: Worth watching for Hawks fans, or fans of the genre, others should watch Only Angels Have Wings (1939) instead.
