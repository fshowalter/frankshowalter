Newman _is_ “Fast” Eddie Felson, a young pool hustler looking to unseat the reigning king, Minnesota Fats, played by Gleason. The script is honest and hard-hitting, the seedy pool halls drip atmosphere and the cast, with the exception of Laurie, is perfect. Laurie herself does a fantastic job for much of the film, but overplays her most intense scenes, striking the lone disingenuous note in this otherwise perfect film.
