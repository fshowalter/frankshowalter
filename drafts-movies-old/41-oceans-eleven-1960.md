Sinatra reunites his squad of World War II paratroopers in a plot to simultaneously rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Years Eve. If you're not a fan of Sinatra and company, the film has little going for it. The story's paper-thin and little more than an excuse for Sinatra, Martin, and Davis to play off each other.   Yet it's that interplay that makes it so entertaining. It's decades of performances on stage, on screen, and on record distilled into a two hour show. It's the showpiece of the Rat Pack's impact on the pop-culture lexicon. It's a time capsule. It's charisma personified. After this film's success, the cast would go on to make several more films together, but it's this one that comes to mind when you think of the Rat Pack.
