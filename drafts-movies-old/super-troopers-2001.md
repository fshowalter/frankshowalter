Synopsis: A group of misfit state troopers facing the closure of their office tries to save their jobs.

Super Troopers is another movie that grows on you.  The first time I saw it, I didn’t much care for it, but subsequent viewings have brought me around.

Super Troopers is strongest in the first half, before it gets bogged down in plot.  The antics of the Broken Lizard group are genuinely funny and a welcome change from the usual gross-out humor that passes for comedy in many movies.  Watching the film, you can’t help but get the sense that these guys had a lot of fun making the movie, and it shows on the screen.

The second half is noticeably weaker, when the plot mechanics force the group off-screen and the film starts to drag a little.  Fortunately, even this weak half is better than most comedies.

Bottom Line: If you’ve never seen it, give it a look.  If you’ve seen it and weren’t impressed, give it another shot; you might be surprised.
