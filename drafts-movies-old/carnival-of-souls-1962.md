Synopsis: A young woman survives a car accident, only to be haunted by strange visions.

Carnival of Souls takes only ten minutes to establish its premise (the car accident happens during the opening credits!).  Unfortunately, once said premise is established, the plot dries out.

There’s atmosphere to spare here, and many of the scenes are genuinely creepy, but this movie feels like a Twilight Zone episode stretched way too long.

There’s simply no story.  The strange visions start out creepy but, with no plot advancement, soon end up feeling repetitive, and the ending, while fitting, simply doesn’t pack enough of a payoff to make the previous 80 minutes worth it.

Bottom Line: Atmosphere alone doesn’t make a movie.
