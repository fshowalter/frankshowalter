Subversive comedy with would-be playboy wolves Holden and Niven vying to seduce virginal sheep McNamara, who's the real manipulator, playing the two for attention and a marriage proposal. Granted, it's talky and the ending is far-fetched, but Preminger's film is no _Every Girl Should Be Married (1948)_, thanks to Holden and Niven playing off each other nicely and McNamara somehow remaining likable throughout.
