After being wounded while pursuing his father’s killers, Wayne's nursed back to health by Burns. Wayne's buddy, played by Reed Howes, plans to marry Burns and soon grows jealous of Wayne, a situation exploited by Wayne's father's killers. Nosler's story is fine, if a bit tired, and Burns actually registers as Wayne’s love interest, a rarity among Wayne’s female co-stars in these Monogram productions, but the script is talky and lacking in Canutt's signature stunts. In a genre known for sacrificing story for action, this entry opts to sacrifice action for story, with disappointing results.
