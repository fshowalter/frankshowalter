Synopsis: A business man (Cary Grant) rooms with an athlete (Jim Hutton) and a young woman (Samantha Eggar) during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

Walk Don't Run is an amiable movie, but notable only as Cary Grant's final film. Jim Hutton echos a young James Stewart, and Samantha Eggar, while not totally charming, is pleasing enough; but this movie is very much a victory lap for Grant who, even at 62, had more charm and presence than most any actor to ever live.

As a movie, Walk Don't Run is passable, with a few laughs here and there, but in the end it doesn't matter. Nobody watching this movie cares about Hutton or Eggar, or even the story, they're there to see Cary Grant be Cary Grant one last time. And he doesn't let them down.

Bottom Line: A must-see for Grant fans, others can pass.
