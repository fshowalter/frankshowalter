Synopsis: During the Korean War, a Navy pilot (William Holden) undertakes a dangerous mission to bomb key bridges in North Korea. 

The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a descent war melodrama buoyed by a strong cast, good special effects, and an excellent ending. 

Stars William Holden and Grace Kelly have charisma to spare, with Holden giving a nice preview of the cynical soldier persona he would perfect a few years later in <a href="/browse/reviews/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai-1957/">The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)</a>, and Kelly radiating her usual charm despite her thin role. 

Supporting them, Fredric March is good as Holden's superior officer, and Mickey Rooney almost steals the film as a fiery tempered helicopter rescue pilot. 

The film is uneven for most of its running time. Some scenes, especially the military action, work well thanks to the good production and excellent special effects, while others, such as the bath scene with Holden and his family, feel forced and artificial. This imbalance would really hurt the film if it weren't for the unexpected, yet utterly believable ending that saves the film.

Ultimately though, The Bridges at Toko-Ri can't stand up to the aforementioned The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) which trumps it in every aspect, be it performances, special effects, or even the ending. While fans of David Lean's film may want to give The Bridges at Toko-Ri a look, don't hold it to the same standards.
