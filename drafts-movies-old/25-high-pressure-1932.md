Powell plays a fast-talking borderline con-man brought in to promote a company who claims to be able to make rubber from sewage. The film's at its best early on, with Powell and Frank McHugh pulling off cons left and right, but then McHugh disappears for much of the film and Evelyn Brent shows up. According to TCM, Brent got the part at the insistence of Powell, which makes their lack of chemistry all the more baffling. She's flat from start to finish, but at least she doesnâ€™t overplay the part. Right about here is where the film starts to drag. Powell does his best, but the drama between him and Brent feels forced, and the script starts to take itself too seriously. It's not a total wash-out, but you're better off with the similar, but superior, Fashions of 1934 (1934).
