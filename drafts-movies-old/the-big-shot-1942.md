Synopsis: An ex-con (Humphrey Bogart) tries to escape the cycle of crime and prison he's trapped in.

The Big Shot is a frustrating movie. It features Humphrey Bogart in his prime, but unfortunately he's saddled with a sub-par script and an even weaker supporting cast. While the direction shows moments of inspiration (particularly the closing sequence), these moments are few and far between.

And about that title, Bogart doesn't really play a "big shot" in the movie. He plays a former safe-cracker trying to go straight. I guess the studio figured "Old Softie" wouldn't sell as many tickets.

Bottom Line: For Bogart completists only, everyone else move along.
