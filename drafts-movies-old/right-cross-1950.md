Synopsis: A boxer (Ricardo Montalban) struggles with personal and professional insecurities while rivaling his best friend (Dick Powell) for the daughter (June Allyson) of his aging promoter (Lionel Barrymore).

Right Cross is an interesting little drama notable chiefly as one of the early appearances of Marilyn Monroe, who has a small, but memorable, scene as one of Dick Powell's character's would-be love interests. But that's not to say the film doesn't stand up on its own. 

Despite taking third billing to real-life couple June Allyson and Dick Powell, this is Ricardo Montalban's movie, and he carries it well, giving a nuanced portrayal of a man struggling to reconcile his pride, his insecurities, and his dreams. 

The script by Charles Schnee doesn't go in for the typical melodrama, and really has little to do with boxing. Instead, it's a character-driven piece that dances around several hot button issues including racism and infidelity. While, admittedly, it's too talky, and hamstrung by 1950's sensibilities, it's still a step up from the typical studio melodrama. Director John Sturges handles things in the same workman-like manner he employed in his previous pairing with Montalban, the slightly superior <a href="/browse/reviews/mystery-street-1950/">Mystery Street (1950)</a>.

Unfortunately, Right Cross is a hard film to recommend, as boxing fans will be disappointed that the film isn't really a boxing movie, and fans of leads June Allyson and Dick Powell will be disappointed to find that, not only are they not playing a couple, but they take a backseat, story-wise to Montalban. Indeed, the folks most likely to enjoy the film are the fans of Montalban, who'll find a lot to savor in his rich performance.
