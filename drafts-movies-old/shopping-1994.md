Synopsis: Disenchanted British youths (Jude Law, Sadie Frost) steal cars and crash them into storefronts.

Shopping tries really hard to be something deeper than it is.  Unfortunately, it never quite succeeds.  It wants to reflect the generation’s condemnation the vapid materialism of the 80s, yet Jude Law’s hair is always perfectly gelled and his clothes are a perfect fit.  It wants to express the frustration of youth, yet the worst these hooligans do is try and loot a mall.

Still, Jude Law is amiable enough, and Sadie Frost manages to avoid being whiney in a part that gives her little else to do.

Two years later Danny Boyle would deliver Trainspotting, the movie Shopping, in many ways aspires to be.

Bottom Line: Watch Trainspotting instead.
