McKay's satire of the buddy cop genre works great early on, with Johnson and Jackson playing a super-cop duo going to absurd lengths to bring down a suspect. Things get a little more hit-or-miss once the film shifts to Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg's characters, the titular "Other Guys" who stumble upon an enormous white-collar conspiracy. Both are good in their respective roles, as is the supporting cast, particularly Michael Keaton as their chief, but in telling a serious story, McKay can't help falling into the very genre trappings he satirized earlier in the film.
