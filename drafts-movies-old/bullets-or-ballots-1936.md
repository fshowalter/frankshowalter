Synopsis: A disgraced detective (Edward G. Robinson) punches out his boss and joins the mob, but one hood (Humphrey Bogart) doesn't buy it.

Bullets or Ballots is an entertaining enough entry in the Warner Brothers gangster genre, albeit one that would be done better a few years later as the similar, but not identical, <a href="/browse/reviews/the-amazing-dr-clitterhouse-1938/">The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938)</a>. This time around, things are a bit more predictable, but lead Edward G. Robinson carries things well, playing a super-tough guy who ain't afraid of nobody, see?

Opposite Robinson, Joan Blondell is fine as his semi love interest, and Humphrey Bogart is great as his chief antagonist. Bogart crackles, really making his mark despite getting only forth billing and a meager amount of screen time compared to Robinson. Frank McHugh even shows up in an odd, and somewhat extraneous, part as one of Blondell's helpers, but he's welcome nonetheless as solid comic relief. 

Granted, the story is a bit on the ridiculous side, but the ending is satisfying enough and the script's breakneck pace, packing a ton of plot and action into only 82 minutes, means you won't be bored. Thus, making Bullets or Ballots an easy recommendation for fans of Warner's gangster pictures, or of star Edward G. Robinson.
