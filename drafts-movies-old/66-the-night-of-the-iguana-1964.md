Burton plays a defrocked priest struggling to contain his sexual urges while eking out a living as a tour guide in Mexico. After an encounter with a lusty teenaged nymphette in his charge prompts his tour group of Baptist spinsters to wire his boss, Burton panics and diverts the group to a seaside hotel run by Gardner, a worldly free spirit struggling to understand why her hedonistic lifestyle leaves her unfulfilled. Gardner has a soft-spot for Burton, but things get even more complicated when prim, proper, and repressed Kerr shows up with her ailing poet grandfather. Burton's feelings for Kerr prove to be the tipping point, forcing him to confront his own inequities as a man too flawed for his own dreams. Intense, gripping and honest performances, particularly from Burton and Gardner, along with the remote tropical locales and a nonjudgmental eye from Huston keep this adaptation of Tennessee Williams's play feeling fresh and relevant over fifty years later.
