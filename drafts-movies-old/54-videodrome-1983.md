Woods plays a sleazy cable-TV station operator who becomes obsessed with a mysterious, ultra-violent, underground show called Videodrome. Cronenberg's visionary commentary on the influence of media has aged very well. Substitute the internet for television and its message is just as relevant--and disturbing--today as it was almost thirty years ago. Despite their age, the special effects haven't lost their unsettling edge, and the performances from Woods and Harry still feel authentic and relatable. Topping it all off, the HD transfer streaming on Netflix makes it look like it was shot yesterday. Long live the new flesh.
