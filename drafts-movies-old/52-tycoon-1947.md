Wayne is an engineer hired by Hardwicke to build a tunnel through the Andes. Wayne wants to build a bridge instead, because it's safer for his crew, but Hardwicke wants a tunnel  because its cheaper for his stockholders. Things get even more heated after Wayne falls for Hardwicke's daughter, Day. The cast is solid, and the Technicolor's nice but the script is a hodgepodge of romance adventure and drama that director Wallace can't seem to get his arms around, resulting in an overlong film that is mediocre at best.
