Synopsis: A smooth talking but chauvinistic man (Campbell Scott) tries to teach his nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) how to pick up women.

Roger Dodger is a biting comedy-drama featuring an excellent script from director Dylan Kidd and a knockout performance from Campbell Scott.

Together, Kidd and Scott create a hypnotic film that lures you in with Scott's effortless portrayal of the titular character, a smooth-talking but bitter man that Scott somehow manages to make relentlessly compelling, and traps you with its brutal, biting observations on sex, relationships, and gender. 

It's the kind of movie that could have spun into a dark, depressing mess or an over the top satire very easily, but Kidd and Scott find the perfect balance from the opening moments and never waver. 

The supporting cast is great too.  Jesse Eisenberg is believable (and age appropriate) as Scott's character's nephew and Isabella Rossellini gives a perfectly measured performance as Scott's character's boss. 

All this is even more impressive when you consider the fact that Roger Dodger was Kidd's first film, yet he seems totally in comfortable behind the camera, eschewing any fancy camera tricks or gimmicks while still managing to make the film visually interesting by exploiting the New York City locales.

Finally, Roger Dodger holds up very well to repeat viewings, due in large part to the perfect ending that manages to offer some sense of redemption for Campbell's character without feeling forced or saccharine.
