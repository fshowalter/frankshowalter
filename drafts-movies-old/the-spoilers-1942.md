Synopsis: In gold rush Alaska, a cocky young miner (John Wayne) rivals a crooked official (Randolph Scott) for a saloon owner’s (Marlene Dietrich) affections.

The Spoilers is an entertaining John Wayne entry, notable chiefly for its strong cast.  Harry Carey plays the Duke’s partner, while Marlene Dietrich provides a leading lady capable of holding her own despite Wayne’s considerable screen presence.  Opposite them, Randolph Scott plays a great villain and manages to make an impression despite having relatively little screen time.

The film’s highlight is a well-choreographed saloon brawl with Wayne and Scott trashing as much of the saloon as they do each other.  Director Ray Enright’s decision to speed up parts of this sequence is a questionable one, as the obvious effect detracts from the great stunt work.

The biggest problem with The Spoilers though, is that it’s Marlene Dietrich’s picture.  She gets top billing most of the screen time, despite the fact that Wayne is clearly the film’s biggest asset.  Still, good production and a lean 87-minute script round help keep this one entertaining.

Bottom Line: While John Wayne fans will certainly enjoy it, a little more Duke would have gone a long way.
