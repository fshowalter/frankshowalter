Synopsis: A cockney ne’er-do-well (Cary Grant) returns home and takes stock of his life after his mother (Ethel Barrymore) falls ill.

None But the Lonely Heart is a flawed, but well put together melodrama.

Cary Grant works well in the lead, as his indelible charisma makes him believable as a would-be-loveable rogue.

Ethel Barrymore won a well-deserved Oscar for her restrained performance as Grant’s character’s mother.  In a part that could –especially toward the end— veer into theatrics, Barrymore instead instills the character with a quiet dignity.

The script packed with authentic feeling dialog, and does a great job of subtly transforming Grant’s character, delivering a solid emotional punch at the end once the transformation is complete.

Director Clifford Odets does a good job establishing a gloomy atmosphere, but offers little more visually.  The 113-minute running time feels a little excessive, especially towards the film’s middle, and the voice over narration at the film’s opening is totally unnecessary.

Bottom Line: A decent melodrama, worth watching for Grant and Barrymore fans.
