Synopsis: A brutal vigilante (Ray Stevenson) battles a disfigured mobster (Dominic West).

Punisher: War Zone is the best Punisher film yet. That's not to say it's perfect, far from it, but it's definitely several steps in the right direction.

First, Ray Stevenson is great as the titular character. His hulking 6'4 frame, dark features and worn countenance fit the part well. He handles the action scenes with ease and seems equally comfortable in the dramatic ones. Stevenson is easily the best thing about the film.

Next, this iteration finally sets the action in New York, replete with a supporting cast sporting genuine New York accents. Unfortunately, the film lacked the budget to actually film in the Big Apple, substituting Montreal, which gives many of the sets an artificial feel. Like much of the film, it amounts to a step in the right direction that just fell short.

The same goes with the villain, played by Dominic West. He's a definite improvement over previous installments, but in light of Heath Ledger's turn in <a href="/browse/reviews/the-dark-knight-2008/">The Dark Knight (2008)</a>, he just falls short, lacking real menace and terror. Instead, he comes across as a cross between Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991).  Further, his henchman-brother, played by Doug Hutchinson, is a redundant character that should have been folded into West's central antagonist.

The script is also a mixed bag. While it's certainly a step up from the previous effort, in that it contains actual <em>punishing</em>, it also includes yet another sad-Punisher arc where Stevenson's character mopes and doubts himself. Why, oh why, do screenwriters feel compelled to include this tired plot device? Granted, the script wisely limits Stevenson's dialog, eschewing cheesy one-liners and the like, but it's also nowhere near the ice-cold, Dirty Harry-esque, vehicle it's meant to be.

 As a director, credit Lexi Alexander with the Stevenson casting, the grittier atmosphere and gratuitous violence, but ultimately she fails to elevate the film from its comic book roots. It shouldn't be that hard, especially considering it's practically been done by the likes of Eastwood and Bronson, but as long as we have shots of heavily armed Stevenson jogging down semi crowded city streets to his hideout, we'll remain firmly in fantasy land.
