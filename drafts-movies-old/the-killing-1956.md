Synopsis: An ex-con (Sterling Hayden) masterminds a daring racetrack robbery.

The Killing is, in many ways, an evolution of John Huston’s <a href="/browse/reviews/the-asphalt-jungle-1950/">The Asphalt Jungle (1950)</a>.  Both are heist pictures, and both star Sterling Hayden, but director Stanley Kubrick puts his own stamp on The Killing by telling the story in a non-linear fashion, zigzagging back and forth in the timeline to show how the various pieces of the crime came together.

The result is a technically solid, and groundbreaking, film, that helped bridge the gap between Huston’s The Asphalt Jungle and modern films such as Quentin Tarantino’s <a href="/browse/reviews/reservoir-dogs-1992/">Reservoir Dogs (1992)</a>.

Unfortunately, The Killing suffers from some awful voice-over narration (supposedly studio-mandated) and a lot of expository dialog.  These two combine to give the film a very Dragnet-esque feel that ends up robbing the film of much of its edge. Compounding this is a solid, but unspectacular cast that does little to elevate the story.  The biggest star here is Kubrick himself, with his meticulous attention to detail and inventive camera work.

Bottom Line: Had The Killing been made later in Kubrick’s career, when he could attract big name talent and command a larger budget, it would likely rank as one of his finest pictures, but as is, it’ll likely appeal to genre fans and Kubrick aficionados only.
