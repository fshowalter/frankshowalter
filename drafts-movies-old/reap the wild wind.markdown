<cite>Reap the Wild Wind</cite> unfolds in the 1840s, when the sea was the heart of American commerce with critical routes running through the shoal-laced waters of the Florida Keys. John Wayne plays Captain Jack Stuart who, as the film opens, is unconscious, having been knocked out by a treacherous first mate who's been paid to scuttle the ship by underhanded salvager King Cutler, played by Raymond Massey. 

Jack is saved by Loxi Claiborne, a Scarlett O'Hara clone played by Paulette Goddard who inherited her father's salvage business. Jack and Loxi fall in love, but things get complicated when Jack's rival, the foppish Steve Tolliver, played by Ray Milland enters the picture. He falls for Loxi too and soon Jack's making a deal with the devil in the form of Cutler, planning to scuttle his dream ship, The Southern Cross in return for enough money to ensure he and Loxi can live a good life together. Things don't go as planned, however, and Jack finds himself on trial for deliberately wrecking the vessel. 

Then Jack and Steve fight a giant squid.

<cite>Reap the Wild Wind</cite> was director Cecil B. DeMille's answer to <cite>Gone with the Wind</cite>. Shot in technicolor and featuring set pieces packed with the then-pinnacle of special effects, DeMille spared no expense.

But all the gloss can't distract from the wealth of lines characters deliver while gazing at nothing in particular, nor from the script that somehow goes from a court room sequence to the prosecutor and defendant diving for evidence. Wayne and Lynne Overman, who plays Loxi's old salt skipper, are the lone bright spots in a dull mess of a movie that's only notable today as one of the few instances where Wayne plays a bad guy. Or, at least, a good guy gone bad.
