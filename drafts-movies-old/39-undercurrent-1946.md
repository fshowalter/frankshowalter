Dowdy Hepburn marries wealthy Howard Hughes-esque Taylor, and begins to suspect that either he, or his mysterious, never-spoken-of brother, played by Mitchum, may be a murderer. It starts promising, but, as it unfurls, the twists and misdirections feel forced, and Hepburn can't convince as a damsel in distress any more than Mitchum can as a sensitive bookish-sort. Disappointing.
