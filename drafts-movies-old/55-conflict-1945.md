Bogart plays an engineer carrying a secret torch for his wife's sister, played by Smith. When his wife won't give him a divorce, Bogart executes what he thinks is the perfect murder, but soon the evidence begins to mount that his wife may still be alive. 

A solid, if unremarkable mystery-thriller notable chiefly for Bogart's milestone performance. While he'd certainly played villains before, none had been so multi-dimensional and it's roles like this that elevated him from simple movie star to world-class actor. Opposite him, Greenstreet, playing the "good guy" for a change, acquits himself nicely, as does the rest of the supporting cast, with the exception of Grant Mitchell, whose wooden, one-note performance drags down all of his scenes.
