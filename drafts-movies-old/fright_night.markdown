Suburban teenager Charley Brewster glances out his window during a late-night make-out session with his girlfriend and sees two men carrying a coffin into the basement of the vacant neighboring house. Intrigued, Charley begins spying on the nightly goings on next-door, and soon discovers that his suave new neighbor Jerry Dandrige has fangs.

Now, Charley spends most of his nights watching the local creature-feature Fright Night, and knows a vampire when he sees one, but everyone else thinks he's crazy. Desperate for help, Charley turns to turn to the one man he's certain will believe him, the host of Fright Night, washed-up horror actor Peter Vincent.

<cite>Fright Night</cite> is writer/director Tom Holland's love letter to classic horror films, with emphasis on the Hammer vampire pictures of the late 1950's and 1960s. Holland's film starts out as more-or-less a comedy, satirizing the often hammy acting in the Hammer productions only to transition into a straight horror that brings their shocks up to contemporary levels. 

While the Peter Vincent name may be an amalgam of horror icons Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, the character is entirely Cushing, and Roddy McDowall has a lot of fun with it, hamming it up in the movie-within-a-movie early on, and dialing it back just enough in the second half to make things work. 

Opposite McDowell, Holland and actor Chris Sarandon craft a true villain in Jerry Dandrige, one that stood in marked contrast to the then-current trend of one-dimensional, faceless, monsters hacking their way through teenage campers. 

The resulting film is not only a tremendous amount of fun for horror fans, but one that takes its place as a classic alongside the very films it pays tribute to.
