<cite>Frankenstein 1970</cite> opens with the standard gothic horror trappings: a young girl dressed in a nightgown running from a lumbering monster through a fog-shrouded forest. On cue, the girl loses her footing and falls to the ground. The monster get closer. The girl gets up to run, but she's cornered against a small pond. She wades out, the monster follows. The water's waist deep as the monster reaches her, grabbing her with both hands by the throat and choking her down. Then, offscreen, someone yells "Cut!"

Yes, it's a movie-within-a-movie. Or, as the clumsy exposition that follows tells us: a-television-special-within-a-movie in honor of the anniversary of the original Frankenstein monster. The production is filming in and around Frankenstein's castle, thanks to the participation of last descendent of the Frankenstein family, Baron Victor von Frankenstein, played by Boris Karloff.

Some more clumsy exposition later, and we learn that the Baron hasn't been himself since the Nazi's tortured him during the war for refusing to aid them. Now, he needs cash for a secret project, and after having sold off his art collection is reduced to renting out his home and lineage to a TV crew.

Speaking of the crew, there's some drama there too, the press agent's after the secretary, who's carrying a torch for the director, who's hot for the actress. This represents the extent of their combined characterizations. 

Meanwhile, we discover the nature of the Baron's secret project. To no surprise, the Baron has taken up the family occupation, building a new monster, only this time using atomic power. The darkened laboratory, packed with bubbling vials of mysterious liquids and lit only by flashes of giant arcing electrical sparks is gone, replaced by a white plastic control room full of dials, switches, and meters. A set that could, and probably did, double for the interior of a spaceship. 

Moving on, it seems the Baron has run up against the same problem that always tripped up his ancestors: access to quality parts. Murdering his trusted manservant gets him a brain, and a couple more murders gets him a pair of eyes. Now his creature is complete, a hulking bandage-wrapped mummy with a giant square head that looks like a radiation suit helmet. 

By now, the crew is suspicious. The cinematographer's gone missing and they're starting to suspect the Baron. They do some investigating and find some circumstantial evidence, prompting the Baron to hypnotize one of them with a ten-thousand dollar coin that he apparently forgot to sell as part of his efforts to raise money. Of course, the Baron's plan fails and, with the authorities closing in, he kills himself and the monster with a radiation overdose. 

It's hard to tell exactly what the filmmakers were after. The opening, along with the futuristic title, would suggest a rebuke of the gothic genre in favor of the sci-fi wave that swept 1950's cinema, yet the movie-within-a-movie is better than the actual movie. If it was an attempt to deconstruct the Frankenstein mythos, they fail to offer anything new aside from a cheaper lab set. 

In truth, <cite>Frankenstein 1970</cite> was a quick, cheap attempt to cash in on the success of <cite>Curse of Frankenstein</cite> and <cite>I Was a Teenage Frankenstein</cite> using Karloff's name and legacy. For his part, Karloff, who was under contract, gives his all, but with so little to work with, can't do much. It's a real shame, as the idea of Karloff playing the doctor in a modern retelling of the story is intriguing, but Hammer had already shown that Technicolor blood is a much better update than atomic power in their aforementioned <cite>Curse of Frankenstein</cite>, which is a much better choice if you're looking for a Frankenstein fix.
