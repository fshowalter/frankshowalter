Synopsis: A derelict (William Powell), living in the city dump, becomes a butler for a rich eccentric family. 

My Man Godfrey is an entertaining comedy thanks in large part to the considerable charm of William Powell.

Opening with a refreshingly clever credit sequence, the film grabs you right from the first scene with Powell’s endearing performance.  He carries the film and is simply a joy to watch.

Less charming however, is Powell’s romantic lead Carole Lombard, who displays none of the charisma she did in <a href="/browse/reviews/in-name-only-1939/">In Name Only (1939)</a>.  Here she’s an annoying brat prone to tantrums.  Further, she and Powell have little visible chemistry, despite (or perhaps because of) having been married briefly a few years earlier.  This is exasperated by the curious lighting, which makes Lombard seem to wear a five o’clock shadow throughout most of the film.

Lombard as a romantic lead aside, the rest of the sparkles.  Alice Brady is great fun as Lombard’s character’s scatterbrained matriarch, as is Eugene Pallette as the long-suffering father, while Gail Patrick is deliciously evil as Lombard’s character’s wicked sister.  Their interactions go a long way toward carrying the film when Powell is off screen.

Bottom Line: It’s a testament to the star power of William Powell that this romantic comedy still works despite the lack of believable romance.
