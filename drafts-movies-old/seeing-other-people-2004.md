Synopsis: A recently engaged woman (Julianne Nicholson) convinces her fianc√© (Jay Mohr) that they should have assorted flings before their wedding.

Seeing Other People is a sometimes funny, sometimes insightful, comedy drama that very nearly overcomes its somewhat clunky premise.

Provided you can buy Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr as a couple who think themselves liberal and enlightened enough to believe the idea of each having a slew of flings before their wedding is a good one, you should be able to sit back and enjoy the script's mostly even-handed and insightful comments on sex and relationships and what they mean to men versus women. There's a lot of good stuff here, and more than a few good chuckles, but the urge to wrap the ending in a pleasant manner undermines the film's potential. Yes, it's a comedy, but that doesn't mean it can't have teeth.

Somewhat offsetting the weak third act is the strong supporting cast, including Josh Charles, Andy Richter, and Lauren Graham. Richter in particular, shines as the most likeable character in the entire film.

Ultimately, Seeing Other People is entertaining enough, but lacks the edge necessary to induce a second viewing. Its failure to challenge the viewer is disappointing, especially given the film's apparent willingness to take its premise seriously, at least for the first two acts.
