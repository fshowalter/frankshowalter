Synopsis: A folksy judge (Will Rogers) outwits his rivals in a small southern town.

Judge Priest is somewhat similar to star Will Rogers and director John Ford’s previous pairing, <a href="/browse/reviews/doctor-bull-1933/">Doctor Bull (1933)</a>. Again, Rogers plays a folksy professional facing upheaval within a small town, but Judge Priest is much lighter in tone than Doctor Bull, and, as such, works better.

Will Rogers is perfect as the titular character, and his natural charm carries the film well. The supporting cast is a mixed bag though, as Tom Brown is a little stiff as Rogers’ character’s nephew, though Berton Churchill and Henry B. Walthall are excellent as Rogers’ character’s chief rival and the town Reverend respectively.

Director Ford once again does a great job capturing the atmosphere of a small town, and stages some impressive shots given the technical limitations of the budget and times, but, like Doctor Bull, Judge Priest is ultimately light on story, and feels a little long, even at only 80 minutes.

Bottom Line: Judge Priest is worth a look for fans of Will Rogers or those curious about director John Ford’s early career, but others needn’t bother.
