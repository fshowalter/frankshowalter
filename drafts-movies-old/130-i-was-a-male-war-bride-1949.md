In occupied Germany, French Captain Grant and American Lieutenant Sheridan bicker and eventually fall in love and marry, only to face complications when she has to return to America. Like most screwball fare, much of the humor derives from simple misunderstandings that arise when one character refuses to shut up long enough to let the other talk. These bits are more frustrating than funny, and would sink the film if it weren't for bits like Grant's attempt to exit Sheridan's room in a creaky old inn, or the finale with Grant in would-be drag, that make it worth enduring the screwball antics.
