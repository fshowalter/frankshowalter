Synopsis: A girl from the valley (Deborah Foreman) falls for a new wave boy from the city (Nicolas Cage), much to the dismay of her friends.

After the surprise success of <a href="/browse/reviews/fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-1982/">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a>, studios rushed several copycats into production.  Valley Girl is, unfortunately, one of those copycats.

The movie, like the stereotypical title character, simply doesn’t have much to it.  It’s a love story where you don’t particularly care if the characters will end up together, because you already know they will.  It’s a satire that has nothing to satirize except the way a few characters talk.  It’s a sex comedy without the sex.

It’s not all bad, however.  The soundtrack is pretty good, the valley girl dialog is worth a chuckle, and Nicolas Cage has a moment or two of inspired weirdness, but that’s about it.

Bottom Line: If you’re not a fan of the genre or the decade, subtract a letter from the grade, otherwise
