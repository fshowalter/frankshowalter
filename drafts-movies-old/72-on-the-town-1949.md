Kelly and Sinatra plays sailors with 24 hours to meet girls and see sights of New York City. Aside from MGM's ever-present typecasting of Sinatra as a na√Øve boy next door type that handicaps his natural charm, the movie's only real stumble is the indulgent performance-within-a-movie where Kelly, Vera-Ellen and a cadre of dancers retell the film's entire story through dance. Aside from that misstep, this is a fun, airy film featuring some great location photography strung together with more than a few memorable song and dance numbers. Granted, the musical comedy genre doesn't lend itself to much depth, but really, is it meant to? Before there were summer blockbusters, this was the popcorn staple; a breezy 98 minutes to sit back and enjoy, no thought required. While, sadly, this was Kelly and Sinatra's final team up, they certainly went out on a high note.
