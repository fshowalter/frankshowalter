Deneuve plays an emotionally disturbed young woman who crumbles into insanity when left alone in her apartment. With no background music and little in the way of action, the first half of the film can be something of a grind, and though it’s clear where Polanski was going with John Fraser’s character’s obsession with Deneuve’s, it’s just not believable that he wouldn’t pick up on *something* related to her psychosis. Sure, he wants her because he can’t have her, but there’s also a line where most men would simply say she’s crazy and move on. 

Though the fashions may date it, the film doesn’t feel timid or diluted, and remains deeply unsettling, even to modern audiences.  Polanski’s use of creeping shadows, fractured walls, and groping hands as metaphors for Deneuve's sanity pack a hell of a punch, and the closing shot is a knockout blow.
