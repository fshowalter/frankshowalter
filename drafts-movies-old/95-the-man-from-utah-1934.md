Singing cowboy Wayne goes undercover to investigate a crooked rodeo. Thankfully, after recycling the opening sequence from  Riders of Destiny (1933), Bradbury drops the signing cowboy angle, and delivers a passable action-mystery, though he can't be bothered to match Wayne's hat and shirt colors with the stock rodeo footage spliced in throughout the film. And didn't we see that horseback takedown stunt in Sagebrush Trail (1933)?
