Undercover New York cops Stallone and Williams get reassigned to a special unit dedicated to Wulfgar, a media-hungry international terrorist, played by Rutger Hauer. Vivid atmosphere and New York location photography, along with a solid performance from Stallone and a great one from Hauer make this a surprisingly competent crime thriller.
