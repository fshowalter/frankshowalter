Synopsis: In early 20th century Montana, a minister’s two sons (Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt) grow up to be different men, united by their love of fly-fishing.

A River Runs Through It is a quiet, reflective struggle of America’s growing pains, as reflected in the lives of two brothers, well played by Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt.  Pitt in particular shines as the slightly aloof Paul Maclean, whose life is more indicative of a time gone by.

Director Robert Redford makes great use of the Montana locales, although through his eye Montana is caught in a perpetual summer, full of clear skies and green leaves.  While this may not be exactly truthful, it does paint a pretty picture.

Unfortunately, Redford’s relative inexperience behind the camera shows in his inability to modulate the tension throughout the film.  While a sense of melancholy naturally hangs over the story, Redford takes scenes that should be exhilarating, like the brothers’ journey down the rapids, and ratchets the tension too high, robbing the audience of any sense of thrill or wonder.

Bottom Line: A solid, if flawed, film with some beautiful photography.
