In 1930's Paris, Victoria, played by Andrews, is a soprano struggling earn enough to eat until she meets Toddy, played by Preston, a gay, and recently unemployed, cabaret singer. Toddy cooks up a scheme and soon Victoria becomes Victor, the greatest female impersonator in all of Paris. But things get complicated when Chicago mobster King Marchand, played by Garner, falls for Victor/Victoria, and vice-versa. Edwards struggles early, substituting slapstick for characterization, but soon enough Preston's charm takes over and the movie becomes a lot more enjoyable. Andrews and Garner are both great, and even though he insists on injecting bits of dull screwball comedy, Edwards' genuine affection for his characters shows through.
