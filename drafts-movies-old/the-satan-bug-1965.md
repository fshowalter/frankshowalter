Synopsis: A government agent must recover stolen vials of a deadly virus from a madman determined to rule the world.

The Satan Bug is director John Sturges inexplicable follow-up to The Great Escape.

Gone are the wide open spaces that he utilized to such great effect in films like The Great Escape, The Magnificent Seven, and <a href="/browse/reviews/escape-from-fort-bravo-1953/">Escape From Fort Bravo</a>, instead they're replaced by stagy lab sets that date the film horribly.

Missing also, is a star-sudden ensemble cast in the vein of The Great Escape or The Magnificent Seven. Here, Sturges commands a stable of mostly B-movie veterans led by former TV star George Maharis.  While theyâ€™re all surprisingly serviceable, no one is a real standout and the film suffers for it.

The script by James Clavell and Edward Anhalt from the Alistair MacLean novel bears a passing resemblance to a season of the Fox television series "24," though it's neither tense nor believable and loses what little momentum it has in the third act. 

Bottom Line: They must have thrown a hell of a lot of money at Sturges.  How else can you explain this disappointment?
