Corman's follow up to House of Usher is a more-of-the-same mix of camp and genuine thrills featuring Price as a Spanish nobleman teetering on the edge of madness after the recent death of his beloved wife. Kerr is a one-note drone early on, but Price's fun performance and the finale setpiece make up for it.
