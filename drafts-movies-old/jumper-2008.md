Synopsis: A young man (Hayden Christensen) with the ability to teleport finds himself at war with a secret sect lead by a mysterious man (Samuel L. Jackson).

Jumper is a damn frustrating movie.  It’s beautifully shot, with an intriguing premise, and a great performance from Samuel L. Jackson.  Unfortunately, it’s also got some cringe worthy dialog, distractingly large plot holes, and a zero charisma female lead in Rachel Bilson.

The film looks great, featuring some jaw-dropping location photography, but the plot is a hodgepodge of underdeveloped elements.  Diane Lane gets third billing for about five minutes of screen time in a throwaway role with absolutely no payoff.  Jamie Bell, easily the best of the cast aside from Jackson, crafts a far more interesting character than lead Hayden Christensen, yet the script (credited to three different writers) regulates him to little more than a plot device.  Worst of all is Rachel Bilson’s character, who seems like an afterthought at best.  The script’s paper-thin characterization forces her to flesh out her role with sheer charisma, and, unlike Jackson, she’s just not up to it.

There are moments, more than a few, in fact, where Jumper gets it right.  The opening sequence, leading up to Christensen’s character’s discovery of his powers it spot-on, as are just about every one of Jackson’s scenes, but these only serve to build false hope.  This is a movie in search of an identity.  Is it a super-hero movie?  A romance?  A sci-fi epic?  Jumper feels like a movie made by a committee hell-bent on creating a franchise and that, ultimately, proves to be its undoing.  Much as Jackson’s character is fond of saying that no man should be all places at all times; no movie should be all things to all people.

Bottom Line: Jumper is an unfortunate mess of a movie that wastes some beautiful photography and a great performance by Samuel L. Jackson.
