Hawks' salute to the Army Air Corps follows the crew of a B-17 flying fortress as they set out for Pearl Harbor on the eve of the United Statesâ€™ entry into World War II. The first half is rough: the cast is too homogenized and the script is talky, but the second half is much more rewarding as the action picks up and the characters come into their own.
