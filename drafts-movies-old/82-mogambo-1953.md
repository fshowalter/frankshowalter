Gardner plays a chorus girl who finds herself ditched in the African wilds with trapper Gable after learning her Maharaja host has returned to India. There are some sparks, but things get interrupted by the arrival of a bookish anthropologist and his prim wife, played by Kelly. Gable and Kelly become involved, and the triangle comes to a head during a dangerous trip into gorilla country. Good performances, particularly Gardner's, and the African locations can't overcome a watered-down script that feels disingenuous.
