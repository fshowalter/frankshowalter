  The insistence on recreating scenes from the original has characters acting with no clear motivation short of advancing the plot.

Rebel loner Kevin Dillon subs for clean-cut Steve McQueen and the army isn’t quite the white knight it was in the 1958 original, but this remake hits all the same plot points as a group of teenagers struggle to save a disbelieving small town from a gelatinous ooze that consumes its victims while adding to its ever-increasing mass. Where this entry declares its creative independence is via its memorable and gruesome special effects. This blob doesn’t just assimilate its victims, it digests them.

Director Chuck Russell shows a sure hand establishing the small-town atmosphere, and the cast is competent, making for a passable popcorn monster flick, but the script’s insistence on recreating the scenes from the original film while still tweaking the story results in characters often acting with no clear motivation short of advancing the plot. While not a total wash, it is disappointing, especially given that the ending’s obligatory sequel setup is so promising.
