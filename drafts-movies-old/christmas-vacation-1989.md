Synopsis: Family man Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) attempts to host the perfect holiday get-together, with disastrous results.

Christmas Vacation is a funny, charming holiday film.

The script by John Hughes is the perfect mix of holiday sentimentality and frustration.  Combining Chase’s trademark physical comedy and deadpan humor with a touching story of one man’s struggle to do right by his family, Hughes manages to tap into timeless emotions that allow the movie to remain fresh and relevant 18 years after it's release.  This, combined with his clever sidestepping of any religious notions, allows Christmas Vacation to appeal to a wider audience than the average holiday themed movie.

For their part, the cast rises to Hughes’ script.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo, after two films together, have perfected their roles and feel like a real married couple.  Also settling comfortably into his role is Randy Quaid as Chase’s well-meaning but socially inept brother-in-law.  His and Chase’s interactions make for some of the film’s best moments.

If Christmas Vacation has a weakness, it’s that it’s so tied to the holiday season.  While the film ages well year-to-year, it doesn’t fare so well month-to-month.

Bottom Line: A tradition unto itself, Christmas Vacation is a film that deserves to take its place amongst the holiday classics.  Highly recommended.
