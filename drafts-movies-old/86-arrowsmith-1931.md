Colman plays a promising young doctor who tries his hand and small-town medicine but finds himself drawn to research, eventually taking a position at a prestigious New York institute where he develops a serum for bubonic plague. An outbreak in the West Indies provides an opportunity to test his work, but also tests his resolve to maintain a detached, scientific approach. Though the West Indies portion features some excellent atmospheric photography from June, who creates a claustrophobic, almost horrific feel for the scenes involving Colman's wife, the  script's plodding reliance on exposition and head-scratcher ending make this a disappointment.
