- Synopsis: As the Cold War reaches it's boiling point, government-backed team of young superhumans fights thwart the plans of a mutant sociopath bent on starting the next world war.

How does this movie work? How do you make an X-Men movie, set in 1962, _without Wolverine_ and have not only be the best X-Men movie ever made, but maybe the best Marvel movie too? 

You could say it works because it takes a cue from The Dark Knight and grounds everything in an explainable reality. Costumes? Nope, they're flight suits designed to help the wearer withstand g-forces. Super powers? Nope, they're mutations, a natural part of evolution accelerated by the advent of the atomic age. Super villains? Nope, just a sociopath leading a group of disenfranchised outcasts. 

Or, you could say it works because it takes a cue from Mad Men and outfits everyone in retro-trendy clothes and gives what would otherwise be boring sets an art-deco flair.

But you'd be wrong. Why it works can be summed up in a single scene. A group of young mutants, some still teenagers, and their CIA liaison, having just saved the world from nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis, stand battered and bruised on a small island between the US and Soviet  naval fleets. The superpowers, moments ago ready to wipe one another from the face of the earth, recognize that these atomic children wield a power greater either of their armies and agree in a heartbeat to unite and destroy them. The US and Soviet fleets target the mutants and unleash a sky-full of missiles and ordinance on the very people who'd saved them moments ago. Erik Lehnsherr, a holocaust survivor who'd witnessed the murder of his mother at the hands of Nazis, steps forward, holds out his hand, and stops the barrage mid-air. His gaze hardens and he begins to turn the artillery back toward the fleets. 

Charles Xavier, realizing Lehnsherr's intentions, pleads with him: "That's enough, Erik! There are hundreds of people aboard those ships, innocent people, who are just following orders!"

Erik turns to Charles, "I've been at the mercy of men just following orders... never again!"

This begins the split between Erik and Charles, one that culminates with the mutants chosing sides, some leaving with Erik, some staying with Charles. It's a powerful scene that you'll keep coming back to, and one that left me wondering, if I was on that beach and had to chose a side, wouldn't I have gone with Lehnsherr too? 

And _that_ is why this movie works.
