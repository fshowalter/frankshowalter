Robinson plays a timid, straight-laced clerk who happens to look exactly like a notorious gangster who just broke out of prison. Mistaken identities and hijinks ensue. Robinson's good in the dual role, but the script is frustratingly uneven. On the one hand, it eschews any screwball antics, and paints Arthur's character as a refreshingly intelligent female lead, but on the other hand the far-fetched plot offers zero suspension of disbelief. Provided you can get over that hurdle, you'll be fine, if not, it'll seem like a one-joke movie that goes on far too long.
