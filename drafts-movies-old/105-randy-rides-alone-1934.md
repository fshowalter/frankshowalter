Imprisoned for murders he didnâ€™t commit, cowboy Wayne escapes only to inadvertently join up with the real killers. While it's a nice change of pace to see usual good guy Hayes and usual bad guy Earl Dwire swap sides, Fraser's insistence on lingering on a cringe-worthy miniature shot, reusing the hideout set from Sagebrush Trail (1933), and Vaughn's cardboard performance really drag this Monogram entry down. That said, Hayes plays a good antagonist, and it's a nice touch that Parsons has him change into an all black outfit for his villainy, and there's the always solid stunt work from Canutt (who also stars as Hayes' muscle), including a great scene where Canutt, doubling for Wayne, jumps from his horse while crossing a bridge to evade pursuers.
