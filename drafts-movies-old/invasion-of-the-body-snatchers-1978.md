Synopsis: In San Francisco, a health inspector (Donald Sutherland) discovers a horrific alien plan to take over the planet.

Philip Kaufman’s remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a well-produced and well-acted horror film.  In many ways, it’s like a zombie film with less gore and makeup.  Like George Romero’s classic Night of the Living Dead, Kaufman amps the claustrophobic atmosphere while at the same time using the genre to explore socio-political issues. 

Donald Sutherland is perfect in the lead, playing a believable everyman forced to deal with an unimaginable horror.  Equally well cast is Leonard Nimoy, playing the suave psychologist determined to explain everything away.

The script by W.D. Richter does a great job of efficiently painting believable characters, while avoiding most celluloid clichés.  Its only real flaw comes toward the end, when it seems to run out of story and devolves into an extended chase scene.  Fortunately, the film redeems itself with a knockout closing shot that will haunt you.

Bottom Line: A well made sci-fi horror.  Recommended.
