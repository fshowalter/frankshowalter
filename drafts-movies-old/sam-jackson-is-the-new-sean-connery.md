“Sam Jackson is the new Sean Connery.”

Those words fell out of my mouth last night, not as a declaration, but as a realization.

Like Sir Sean before him, Samuel L. Jackson can make any movie he wants without worry of damaging his career.  No matter how badly a film may flop, Jackson comes out unscathed.  While studios may deem the rest of the cast box-office poison, they’re eager to sign Jackson to a follow-up project. It’s good to be Sam Jackson.

The Queen should just knight him now.
