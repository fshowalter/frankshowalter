Surgeon Powell solves a murder with his mystery writer ex-wife Arthur in this failed mix of _Thin Man_ mystery and screwball comedy. Arthur's not funny, Powell's character is a shallow copy of Nick Charles, and though the script packs a labyrinthine mystery with more names than you can count, you’ll have trouble caring, as almost none of the supporting players register. At the same time, you know as soon as Powell starts to grapple with some villain, Arthur’s gonna conk him over the head with something after mistaking him for the other man. Even if the other man is bald and the room is brightly lit. Watch _The Thin Man (1934)_ instead.
