Lee plays a haughty and headstrong actress who takes on Karloff, the corrupt warden of the titular asylum, only to find herself committed to very same institution. Karloff's great, the asylum scenes are creepy, and Richard Fraser somehow makes the "thees" and "thous" seem natural in his role as a pacifist Quaker, but Lee's character is so self-absorbed and unlikable for most of the movie that you can't help but think that maybe she's better off locked up. Probably not what Robson intended.
