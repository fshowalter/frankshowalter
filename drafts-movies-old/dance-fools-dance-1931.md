Synopsis: After her father goes bankrupt, a spoiled socialite (Joan Crawford) goes to work as an undercover newspaper reporter investigating a murder that points to a gangster (Clark Gable).

There really isn't much to Dance, Fools, Dance. It's a pre-code melodrama with gangster dressing that's highlighted by a couple of good turns by Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, though it only shows up here because my TIVO mistook <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390279/">this William Holden</a>, who played Crawford's character's father, for <a href=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000034/>the more famous one</a>, who was only 13-years-old when this film was made, and thus probably wouldn't have been believable as Crawford's dad.

That said, the film isn't that bad either. It moves along at a pretty good click and Crawford is good in the lead. Her scenes with Gable are the film's highlight, and since it's a pre-code picture, it's just racy enough to stay interesting. Unfortunately, Crawford's character's brother, played by Lester Vail, is a bit too one-dimensional, reduced to little more than a plot device that robs the film of a potentially powerful dramatic angle. Further, the story itself is quite ridiculous if given even the slightest thought, though the aforementioned brisk pacing does a good job of keeping you from doing just that.

All and all if you're a big fan of Crawford or Gable, Dance, Fools, Dance is certainly worth a look, but others can easily pass.
