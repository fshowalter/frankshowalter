A spectacular disappointment given the talent involved, this would-be comedy can barely generate the occasional chuckle, let alone a full-blown laugh. 

The all-star cast is wasted. Lorre struggles with his role's physical comedy, Basil Rathbone seems lost, and Karloff literally sleeps through most of his performance. Price is the lone bright spot, as his cartoonish facial expressions are the source of most of the aforementioned chuckles. 

Director Tourneur, near the end of his career, seems to have phoned this one in, as there are some awful day-for-night shots and little of his signature, budget-stretching atmosphere.

What a waste.
