Synopsis: On turn of the century Devil’s Island, three escaped convicts (Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray) end up aiding a shopkeeper they initially intended to rob.

We’re No Angels is a lavishly produced, and particularly wicked, black comedy.  Director Michael Curtiz manages the tricky feat of making Bogart and his accomplices seem both threatening and likable, thus allowing the audience to laugh at some pretty dark material.

The choice casting of Basil Rathbone as the “villain” really helps here, as he and his accomplice John Baer are so clearly evil, Bogart and his crew can’t help but look more sympathetic.

We’re No Angels does have its faults though.  The first half can be a little talky, with far too much exposition, and Gloria Talbott, while adequate, is easily the weak link in the supporting cast.

Bottom Line: Bogart fans will love this rare comedy turn, but others should enjoy it as well.
