Synopsis: A group of thieves gather for the postmortem of a botched robbery.

Reservoir Dogs is slick.  Writer/director Quentin Tarantino borrows and steals from every genre in the book to create a style all his own that’s been aped countless times since.  The script is crammed with great dialog and practically drips testosterone.

The casting is perfect.  From a seemingly resurrected Lawrence Tierney, to the eerily cool Michael Madsen, there isn’t a weak link in the chain.

The only weakness is in the story itself.  Tarnatino tells it as well as can be done, but it’s inherently weaker than other heist films such as Heat.  Still, while it’s not perfect, it’s damn close.

Bottom Line: A modern classic.  Highly recommended.
