Synopsis: An American sergeant (Humphrey Bogart) leads a group of allied soldiers on a retreat across the North African desert.

The Humphrey Bogart may have top billing; Sahara is basically an ensemble film.  The various allied soldiers are all well written, especially Rex Ingram as a Sudanese soldier, and everyone gets a moment to shine.  The Germans on the other hand, are a bit more one-dimensional, but given that this was basically a propaganda film this isn’t surprising.

The well-done action scenes and the somewhat somber third act make Sahara hold up well over time.  Of course, having Bogart in the cast doesn’t hurt either. 

Bottom Line: Fans of Bogart, or the genre, will enjoy it for sure.  Others could do worse.
