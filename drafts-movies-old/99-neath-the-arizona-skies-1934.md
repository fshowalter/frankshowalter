Wayne plays a cowboy protecting half-Indian girl Rickert from crooks eyeing to ransom her for a portion of the oil lease she's inherited. Now, finding a good child actor is, admittedly, very hard, with big-budget productions utilizing nationwide casting calls and auditioning hundreds of performers, but it seems like Fraser and company just picked the first kid they could find, as Rickert turns in one of the worst performances ever, even by child-actor standards. She mumbles her lines and often doesn't even look at her co-stars. Indeed, if she didn't disappear after the first ten minutes or so, the film would be unwatchable, but thankfully, she does disappear, and the film settles into a typical Monogram production, with some good stunt work courtesy Yakima Canutt, including a scaled-down version of the famous horse dive.
