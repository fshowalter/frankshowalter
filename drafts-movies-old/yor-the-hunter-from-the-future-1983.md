Synopsis: A warrior (Reb Brown) battles beasts and barbarians in his quest to find the secret of his origins.

I'll admit, I watched Yor, the Hunter from the Future (Il Mondo di Yor), solely because of its title. I mean, were there multiple Yors, which thus required the "Hunter from the Future" designation for clarity, or were there multiple Hunters from the future, thus requiring the "Yor" designation? Or were there multiple Yor the Hunters, thus requiring the "from the future" designation? The mind boggles.

The kicker is, in its own way, the film lives up to its title. A quarter of the way into the film, we've already seen Yor ax a triceratops to a bloody death as well as hang-glide into a barbarian stronghold using the corpse of a giant, prehistoric bat. 

Yeah, it's like that.

Playing very close to a live action version of Masters of the Universe, this is a bad movie, to be sure, but the production values are just high enough to make it entertaining. Director Antonio Margheriti, who also directed this disappointing <a href=" /browse/reviews/the-virgin-of-nuremberg-1963/">The Virgin of Nuremberg (1963)</a>, does include a few interesting shots and makes the most of his obviously limited budget, but can't overcome the inherit silliness in the source material. Fortunately, this film just takes itself seriously enough to be fun, and easily ranks among the best of the "bad" movies.
