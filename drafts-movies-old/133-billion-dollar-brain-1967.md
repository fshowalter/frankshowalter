Ex-spy Cain gets pulled back into service to uncover old friend Malden's link to crazed Texas billionaire Begley's plan to start an Eastern European revolution with the help of a super-computer. Caine and Malden are fine, as is Oskar Homolka in a good supporting role, but, even with the nice location photography, they can only do so much to gloss over the ridiculous plot, though, admittedly Begley is fun as the bellowing General Midwinter. Hard to believe Russell directed this.
