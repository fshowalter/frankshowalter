Wayne impersonates a wanted man, joins an outlaw gang, and finds both his father's killer and his long-lost kid brother in another script made up of improbable coincidences, made even worse by the copious amount of expository dialog, as evidenced by the very first scene, in which Wayne is inexplicably recounting the tragic events surrounding his father’s death to his long time buddy who’s clearly heard the story several times before. Cast-wise, Wayne and Hayes are fine, and Lloyd Whitlock is suitably smarmy as the head baddie, but Faire is horrible as Wayne’s love interest, as she and Wayne have zero chemistry. At least there's Yakima Canutt’s trademark stunts, including a great runaway carriage scene and a dynamite leap from a galloping horse through a window.
