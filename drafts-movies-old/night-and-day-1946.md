Synopsis: Cole Porter (Cary Grant) rises to become the most successful songwriter of his time.

Night and Day is a highly fictionalized biography of Cole Porter, the composer of such American standards as “Anything Goes”, “My Heart Belongs to Daddy”, “Don’t Fence Me In”, “I Get a Kick Out of You”, and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin”.

While screenwriters Charles Hoffman, Leo Townsend, and William Bowers definitely took liberties with the truth, director Michael Curtiz and star Cary Grant do at least attempt to portray Porter’s emotional aloofness and homosexuality.  Granted, it’s never overt, but its definitely present, especially in the film’s final scene.

Unfortunately, while the film features some of Porter’s best songs, it lacks any great talent to sing them, which was likely a calculated decision so as to not overshadow star Cary Grant, as the vocalists are passable, but ultimately forgettable. 

That said, director Michael Curtiz delivers a visually splendid film in vibrant Technicolor with some great production numbers, and Grant is charming as ever in the lead.  Further, the addition of Monty Wolley playing himself gives the film not only a great supporting performance, but also some semblance of authenticity. 

Bottom Line: Night and Day, while far from a true story, is entertaining enough thanks Cary Grant’s easy charm and Michael Curtiz’s technical competence.
