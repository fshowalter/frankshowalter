Synopsis: A bank robber (Humphrey Bogart), fresh out of prison, lines up one last heist.

High Sierra would be the last time Humphrey Bogart would be forced to take second billing, and for good reason. He's a tour-de-force in this crime epic, and pretty much carries the entire movie.

The script by John Huston is good, but not as tight as some of his better efforts. While  it does a good job moving through quite a bit of story, many of the supporting characters are underdeveloped and forgettable. This is compounded by patches of uncharacteristically trite dialog and ill conceived comedy.

Bottom Line: A great role for Bogie that –with a tighter script– could have been part of a great movie.
