A pseudo-remake of Bogart's earlier picture, San Quentin (1937), with Bogart in the Pat O’Brien role and the Dead End Kids in Bogart’s role. The kids' schtick wears thin fast, but Bogie's solid in what was one of his first chances to show what he could do as a leading man. There’s the obligatory social-justice message at the film’s end, but overall the mercifully short 85-minute running time isn’t too preachy.
