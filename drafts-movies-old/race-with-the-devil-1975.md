Synopsis: After witnessing a satanic human sacrifice, two men (Warren Oates and Peter Fonda) flee with their wives in an RV.

Race with the Devil starts out well enough.  There’s some great location photography, and a nice feel for 70’s Texas atmosphere.  Then the movie starts to get more and more ridiculous.

Screenwriters Wes Bishop and Lee Frost forget the cardinal rule when it comes to films like this, namely keep the audience off balance.  If the action or the thrills lull, even for a moment, the audience might actually think about things like how people are swimming in January, or why Warren Oates continually fires a shotgun into the back of an empty moving truck, or why the protagonists have to stop at night to sleep when they’re on the run <em>in an RV</em>!  And if you let the audience think about these, or any of the other plot holes big enough to drive the aforementioned recreational vehicle through, they’re bound to realize just how stupid it all is.

Granted, Bishop and Frost seem to figure this out in the film’s final quarter, when it shifts from horror to action as the protagonists decide to fight back, but by then it’s much too late. At least, at only 88-minutes, it's all over fairly quickly.

Bottom Line: Race with the Devil opens with lot of potential, but ultimately becomes a victim of its own absurdity.
