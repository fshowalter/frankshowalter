Grant agrees to smuggle tabloid reporter Stewart and his photographer girlfriend, played by Ruth Hussey, into his stuffy ex-wife Hepburn's upcoming society wedding in exchange for keeping his former father-in-law's name out of the papers. This is Hepburn's movie and she does an amazing job of transforming from fairly dislikable at the outset, to downright charming by the end. Opposite her, Stewart's good, if a bit over-the-top, and Grant gets the biggest laugh of the movie with his first scene face-shove. The biggest surprise, however, is Ruth Hussey who comes across as the most charming of all, making you wonder why everyone isn't fighting over _her_.
