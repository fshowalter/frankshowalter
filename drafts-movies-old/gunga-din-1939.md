Synopsis: Three British troops (Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) battle a Thuggee cult with the help of a native water carrier.

Gunga Din is a great adventure picture. It starts with a classic opening credit sequence and closes with a  knock-out action sequence that holds up well to this day.  The leads are fun to watch, and the film ages well.

There are a few missteps though. The score can be overpowering, with musical ques inserted where silence would have much better served the atmosphere, and the script does drag a bit towards the middle. While neither of these are deal-breakers, I can't help but wonder if Howard Hawks --who was scheduled to direct the movie before being fired-- would have made the same mistakes.

Bottom Line: An enjoyable adventure that served as the inspiration for countless films to follow.
