Synopsis: After a failed prank renders him horribly burned, a camp caretaker uses heavy-duty shears to exact his revenge in the woods of upstate New York.

The Burning probably most famous for launching the careers of Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who would go on to become industry powerhouses.  That said, this film is pretty much <a href="/browse/reviews/friday-the-13th-1980/">Friday the 13th</a> with better make-up effects, and <em>slightly</em> better acting, but minus all the other things that made Friday the 13th such a success.

Effects genius Tom Savini actually turned down the Friday the 13th sequel to work on this film and his contributions are the film’s strongest point.  There are a lot of inventive fatalities, most involving industrial garden shears, all thanks to Savini’s talent.

The potential victims of Savini’s handiwork are marginally better than those typically found in the genre.  Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter both make their film debuts, though it’s Brian Backer, of <a href="/browse/reviews/fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-1982/">Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)</a> fame, who gets most of the screen time.  While the dialog and performances aren’t award worthy, it’s not the usual stilted mess that seems to permeate most teen horror entries either.

Unfortunately though, while the effects and acting make the grade, The Burning has little else to recommend it.  The score is derivative and unremarkable and the villain is uninspiring.  Perhaps a knock out ending might have saved this film, ala Friday the 13th, but we’ll never know.

Bottom Line: Die-hard fans of the genre should enjoy The Burning, but others would do well to check out Halloween or Friday the 13th instead.
