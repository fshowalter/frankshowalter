Langella's a seductive force of nature in this streamlined version of Stoker's tale. Stylish cinematography and good production values compensate for Olivier's less than iconic portrayal of Van Helsing and Langella's poofy hairstyle. Though the picture likely seemed too dark and murky in theaters, the new HD transfer looks amazing on a quality screen.
