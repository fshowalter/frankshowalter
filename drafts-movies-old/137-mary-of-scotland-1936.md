Hepburn's a perfect fit as the titular Mary Stuart in this fictionalized account of her return to Scotland through her imprisonment and death at the hands of her rival, Elizabeth I of England, but director Ford reportedly lost interest in the film midway through production due to the meandering plot and blank verse dialog. Heed his instincts.
