Believing he's killed his friend, lawman Wayne turns recluse, only to later become involved with the friend's daughter, played by Browne, and the true killers. Bradbury's script hinges on improbable coincidences and inexplicably has the very stiff Browne talking directly to the camera, but the climax, with Wayne in a car chase is something of a of a novelty. While this may not seem like that big a deal, it's odd enough to have cars in a western, but even odder considering you can probably count the number of John Wayne films with car-chases on your hand. Now granted, this isn't a true car chase as Wayne isn't chasing another car, but still, it's just plain weird seeing the Duke speed off in pursuit.
