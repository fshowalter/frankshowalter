Synopsis: Four high school seniors make a pact to loose their virginity by prom night.

American Pie is an above average teen sex comedy thanks largely due to a likable cast and an honest script.

Jason Biggs is great as the de-facto lead.  He’s the loveable everyman the audience can root for and brings just the right amount of charm and naiveté to the role. 

Other standouts on the cast include Eddie Kaye Thomas as the enigmatic Finch, whose closing scenes with Jennifer Coolidge are one of the film’s highlights, Sean William Scott as the arrogant doofus Stifler, and Alyson Hannigan as a precocious flute player.

The film is crude, to be sure, but the humor feels honest nonetheless, and it’s that honesty that helps lift American Pie above the typical genre entry.  While the ending is tidy, there’s enough ambiguity that it doesn’t feel pat, and the situations and predicaments still ring true almost ten years later. 

Granted, the film isn’t on par with the likes of <a href="/browse/reviews/superbad-2007/">Superbad (2007)</a>, but in many ways American Pie paved the way, reintroducing the hard-R teen sex comedy as a viable genre.

Bottom Line: American Pie is a crude, sometimes gross, teen sex comedy that’s not for everyone, but fans of the genre should definitely enjoy it.
