MacColl, husband Malco and their young, burgeoning psychic son move into a New England mansion unaware that the original owner, Dr. Freudstein, a notorious Victorian surgeon turned undead murderer, lurks in the basement. Despite Blue Underground's pristine transfer, at first watch, Fulci's final entry in his "Gates of Hell" trilogy is an incomprehensible mess, with a head-scratcher script and grating performances. Given that I had a similar reaction to my first viewing of Fulci's _The Beyond (1981)_, and that I now consider that film a veritable classic, I'm going to give this one another shot, maybe in the original Italian, as the English dubbing is atrocious, especially for young Giovanni Frezza.
