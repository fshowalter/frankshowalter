Synopsis: A daydreaming pulp writer (Danny Kaye) finds himself mixed up with a mysterious woman (Virginia Mayo) and a sinister doctor (Boris Karloff).

Your enjoyment of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty will likely be commensurate with your enjoyment of lead Danny Kaye's shtick, as the film's plot is really just a flimsy device to afford Kaye the opportunity do a variety of skits and songs as different characters.

Yes, Boris Karloff has third billing, and there was a scene of him as Frankenstein's monster, though it was apparently dropped for the final cut. This is a shame, as it would have been awesome to see Karloff in the makeup in color. A shame made more so by the fact that they likely cut it in order to give more room to Kaye's mugging.

As for said mugging, it's hit and miss. Kaye's better with the subtler stuff, like his English flying ace, but his broader material ages poorly. Some of his songs are clever, but also overlong and drawn out. Ultimately, if you're a fan of Kaye, you'll love The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and if not, well, if you're watching it for Karloff, you'll be disappointed.
