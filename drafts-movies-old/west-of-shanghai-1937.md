Synopsis: A group of Americans find themselves prisoners of a Chinese warlord (Boris Karloff).

West of Shanghai requires a little investment. The first fifteen minutes or so can be trying, but once Karloff makes his entrance as General Fang the movie comes alive.

Karloff’s over-the-top performance makes the movie. His rapid-fire broken English is snappy and entertaining, and he plays off the otherwise tepid support cast very well. After just a few minutes you’re actually rooting for him, and the script knows it.

Running just 64 minutes, West of Shanghai doesn’t wear out its welcome. A character like Fang can only be entertaining for so long before the novelty wears off, but rather than try and pad the run-time any more, the script wisely wraps things up rather nicely.

Bottom Line: It’s a real shame West of Shanghai isn’t available on DVD. While it’s not a great movie, it sure is a fun one.
