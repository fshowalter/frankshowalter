Synopsis: The true story of a man (Al Pacino) whose botched bank robbery turned into a media circus on a hot summer day in New York City circa 1972.

Dog Day Afternoon is somewhat of a kindred spirit of <a href="/browse/reviews/serpico-1973/">Serpico (1973)</a>. Both were based on true stories, both were directed by Syndey Lumet, both share a gritty realism that permeates every scene, both tell the story of man pushed to extremes by his environment, and both feature knockout performances by Al Pacino.

Dog Day Afternoon’s only weak spot is the story, which, while interesting, doesn’t provide quite enough meat to sustain a two-hour movie.  Still, what the story lacks, the script almost makes up for with some great dialog and colorful characters.

Bottom Line: Another great Pacino/Lumet collaboration.  Recommended.
