Synopsis: In World War II France, two American soldiers (Frank Sinatra and Tony Curtis) vie for the affections of a young woman (Natalie Wood) with a secret.

Kings Go Forth is a solid war melodrama highlighted by a great cast and good production.

Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra are really good opposite each other, so much so, you'll wish they had made more films together. Then again, Curtis has a way of making all of his costars look great, but regardless the Jersey-born Sinatra and Bronx-born Curtis look and feel like a couple of Joes from the neighborhood, and they work perfectly as American soldiers trying to make the best of the situation in war-torn southern France.

Natalie Wood isn't quite as solid. Her accent never feels right, nor does her demure demeanor. Audrey Hepburn might have been a better choice were it not for a crucial plot point that pretty much disqualifies her (though it really disqualifies Wood too). Still, though she's an awkward fit, Wood is passable.

The script by Merle Miller from Joe David Brown's novel is a dark soap opera, and though the ending is a bit much, it's still a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood fare.

But ultimately it's the chemistry between Sinatra and Curtis that make Kings Go Forth worth a look, especially for fans of either performer, as both were on the cusp of some of their most iconic roles; Curtis would follow this with <a href="/browse/reviews/the-defiant-ones-1958/">The Defiant Ones (1958)</a>, while Sinatra would go on to make <a href="/browse/reviews/some-came-running-1958/">Some Came Running (1958)</a>.
