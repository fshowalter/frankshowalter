_Reap the Wild Wind_ is set in the 1840s, when the sea was the heart of American commerce. At least that's what the opening titles tell us. I suppose that's an attempt to lend some gravitas to the ridiculousness that follows.

Loxi Claiborne (Paulette Goddard) is a Scarlett O'Hara clone who's inherited her father's salvage business in the Florida Keys. The film opens with her rushing to the site of a recent shipwreck. She arrives only to find rival salvager King Cutler (Raymond Massey) already there. Loxi doesn't see any of the salvage profits, but she does save the ship's captain, Jack Stuart (John Wayne) from drowning. As it turns out, Cutler, paid Jackâ€™s first mate to knock Jack unconscious, scuttle the ship and leave Jack for dead.

Loxi nurses Jack back to health and the two fall in love. Things get complicated when Loxi travels to Charleston. There, the foppish Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland) enters the picture. Loxi plans to seduce Steve to secure a captainship for Jack, but Steve ends up falling for Loxi and returns with her to Florida. Jack feels threatened by Steve. There's an improbable misunderstanding involving Jack's appointment to his dream ship, the _Southern Cross_. The result sees Jack making a deal with the devil in the form of Cutler. Jack agrees to scuttle the _Southern Cross_ in return for enough money to ensure he and Loxi can live a good life together. Things don't go as planned though, and Jack finds himself on trial for wrecking the vessel. Steve, of course, is the prosecutor.

Then Jack and Steve fight a giant squid.

_Reap the Wild Wind_ was director Cecil B. DeMille's answer to _Gone with the Wind_. He spared no expense. He shot in technicolor. He packed his set pieces with the then-pinnacle of special effects.

But all the gloss can't distract from the wealth of lines delivered by characters gazing at nothing in particular. Nor from a script that goes from a court room sequence to the prosecutor and defendant fighting a sea-monster for evidence. Wayne and Lynne Overman, who plays Loxi's old salt skipper, are the lone bright spots. It's a dull mess of a movie that's only notable today as one of the few instances where Wayne plays a bad guy. Or at least, a good guy gone bad.
