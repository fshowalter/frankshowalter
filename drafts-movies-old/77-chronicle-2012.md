DeHaan, Russell and Jordan play high schoolers who gain telekinetic powers after encountering a strange artifact buried underground. Landis' script wisely eschews any burning building rescues or other world threats and focuses on the leads and their adjustment to their new powers. Yes, the found footage gimmick feels a forced at times, but it's a minor blemish overshadowed by the strength of the performances, and when it _does_ work, like during the flying sequence, it's exhilarating.
