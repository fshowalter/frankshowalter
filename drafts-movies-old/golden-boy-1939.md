Synopsis: Lead on by his manager's mistress (Barbara Stanwyck), a violin protégé (William Holden) turns boxer, much to the dismay of his father (Lee J. Cobb).

Golden Boy was William Holden's big break, earning him the eponymous nickname for the rest of his career, as well as forging a lifelong bond between him and star Barbara Stanwyck after she convinced the film's producers to take a shot on the then-unknown actor.

Holden's good in the role too. Bringing a believable naiveté to the part, as well as welcome lack of stage theatrics. He's got the physicality to pass for a boxer, as well as the sensitivity, and vulnerability, to pass for an artist. And he's got great chemistry with top-billed Stanwyck, who's equally perfect as Holden's boxing manager's mistress.

Unfortunately, Lee J. Cobb is nowhere near as well cast. Only seven years older than Holden at the time, yet playing his father, Cobb brings a ridiculous accent and bad makeup to a caricature of a performance that grinds the film to a halt every time he opens his mouth. His performance, combined with the script's overwrought melodrama, including more than a few cringe-worthy lines, are the film's low-points.

Thus, Golden Boy is somewhat uneven, and at 99 minutes probably a bit too long, but for fans of Holden and Stanwyck it's still a must-see, as it marked an important turning point in both performer's careers.
