Synopsis: College friends take a road trip from New York to Texas.

Road Trip is an enjoyable comedy.  While the jokes are hit or miss, most will at least make you chuckle and a few will even get you rolling.  Writer/Director Todd Philips shows some restraint, usually opting for character-based humor rather than the easy gross-out joke.  Granted, he slips once or twice (and these gags don’t stand up to repeat viewings as well as the character bits) but not enough to ruin the movie.

The cast is great.  Seann William Scott steals all his scenes in a group that has real chemistry.  The female leads, while not given much to do, are charming as well, and the various cameos are all entertaining.

Bottom Line: Not bad.  Definitely worth checking out on cable if you’re a fan of the genre.
