Day plays a housewife who's world is turned upside down after she becomes the popular spokesperson for the Happy Soap Company, much to the chagrin of her husband Garner. Time hasn't been kind to this would-be satire of television and domestic roles. Viewed today, it's painfully unfunny, with annoying child actors and out of touch leads whose problems are far removed from any modern reality.
