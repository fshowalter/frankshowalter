Price is a pathologist whose experiments include shooting up LSD in an attempt to scare himself. While a little talky, the film's mix of camp and genuine horror makes for a fun ride. Watch it in HD and the string used to pull the creature along is plainly visible in several shots. Credit where credit's due: the third act twist is a good one.
