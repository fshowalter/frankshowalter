In World War II England, tugboat captain Holden inherits fellow captain Howard's apartment and lover, only to learn he's the latest in a string of doomed men. Vivid production, sharp cinematography, and great performances from Holden and Howard try to gloss over the mediocre script and uneven performance from Loren, who, for the most part, does a great job of not overplaying her part, but falters whenever the dreaded "eerie" music cuts in. Disappointing.
