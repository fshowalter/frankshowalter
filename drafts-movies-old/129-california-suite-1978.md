Based on the play by Neil Simon, the stories of four separate groups, all staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel during Oscar weekend. 

The first features Fonda and Alda as a divorced couple meeting to discuss the future of their daughter. Alda's part seems written for him, and Fonda rises to the material. The second story concerns a British actress and her gay husband, with Smith and Caine delivering nuanced performances that rank as the film's finest. The third story follows two doctors from Chicago, played by Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby, and their wives, as their vacation devolves into one mishap after another, it starts well then veers into farce, before going wonderfully over-the-top and providing some of the film's best laughs. The end battle-royal between Pryor and Cosby will have you in tears from laughter. Finally, the forth story deals with a Philadelphia man, played by Walter Matthau, trying to dispose of a passed out call girl with his wife in the next room. It starts off shakey, but works thanks to Matthau's impeccable timing, though it's still a one-joke story.

The resulting film may not be any more than the sum of its parts, but in this case, those parts are all solid.
