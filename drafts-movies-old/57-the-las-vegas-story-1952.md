Russell plays a former lounge singer who returns to Vegas with her wealthy husband, played by Price, only to encounter murder and her old flame, played by Mature. Good Vegas atmosphere and a great, underrated turn from Price are undone by Mature's stiff performance and a ludicrous finale that seems to exist solely to showcase some helicopter photography. Robert Mitchum and a better ending would have done wonders.
