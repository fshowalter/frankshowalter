Synopsis: A mysterious stranger (Clint Eastwood) helps the citizens of a small mining town prepare for the arrival of three ex-cons bent on revenge.

High Plains Drifter is a solid little revenge movie.  Director and star Clint Eastwood doesn’t bring anything new to table in terms of performance or direction, but he gets the job done.

The script by Ernest Tidyman keeps thing moving along at a good pace and, when as the third act unfolds, brings the whole film together with a punch that makes you rethink everything you’ve seen so far.  And it’s that punch that elevates High Plains Drifter from good to really good, giving you something to chew over long after the credits have rolled.

Bottom Line: Highly recommended for fans of Eastwood or the genre, and others could do a lot worse.
