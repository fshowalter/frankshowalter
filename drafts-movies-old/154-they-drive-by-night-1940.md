Raft and Bogart play brothers trying to get ahead in the trucking business until an accident forces them to go to work for Lupino's husband, whom Raft soon stands accused of murdering. The script works best early, when it peppers Raft and Bogart's life on the road with colorful characters and details. Later, it settles into a remake of _Bordertown (1935)_ that, while competent, never seems as interesting or original as the first half.
