Synopsis: A scientist (Bela Lugosi) plans to create a superhuman army using atomic energy.

Let’s get this out of the way: Bride of the Monster isn’t a good movie.  It’s got stilted acting, some laughable special effects, and plot holes galore.  Despite these shortcomings, it’s not a bad movie either.  It’s an Ed Wood movie.

Director, producer, and co-writer Edward D. Wood Jr. loved his job, and that’s what makes his films so damn entertaining, despite their shortcomings.  He wasn’t just a company hack cashing a paycheck, he genuinely cared about his films and performers, and it shows on screen. 

That said, Bride of the Monster does feature a very entertaining Bela Lugosi performance and some good atmosphere.  Topped off with the giant Tor Johnson and you’ve got a fun, campy, ride that really <em>tries</em> to entertain, and that enthusiasm is contagious.

Bottom Line: While Ed Wood’s movies aren’t for everyone, those that approach them with the right frame of mind will find them entertaining, and Bride of the Monster is no exception.
