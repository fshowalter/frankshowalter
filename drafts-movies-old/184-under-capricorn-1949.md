In 1831 Austrialia, ex-convict turned wealthy and powerful business man Sam Flusky, played by Cotten, befriends fresh-off-the-boat and looking to make his fortune Charles Adare, played by Wilding. Wilding soon falls for Cotten's alcoholic wife, played by Bergman, and sets about rebuilding her self-esteem. But the Flusky house has secrets that, when revealed, cast a new light on everything. Solid performances and Hitchcock's use of the long takes he experimented with in _Rope (1948)_ can't overcome a talky, dull script that feels like a less interesting retread of _Rebecca (1940)_, minus the gothic overtones. A somewhat forgotten entry in the Hitchcock oeuvre, _Under Capricorn_ should probably stay that way.
