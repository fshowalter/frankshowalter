Synopsis: A con-man (William Powell) and his two associates (Bette Davis and Frank McHugh) find themselves legitimate players in the Paris fashion world after a scam goes over too well.

Fashions of 1934 is an enjoyable enough comedy, thanks in large part to short running time and a breezy script that plays to the strengths of its solid cast. 

Lead William Powell, right on the cusp of his one-two star-making punch of <a href="/browse/reviews/manhattan-melodrama-1934/">Manhattan Melodrama (1934)</a> and The Thin Man (1934), carries the film well as a lovable cad, showcasing the urbane charm and tight comedic timing that would soon become his trademarks. 

Opposite Powell, Frank McHugh makes a great sidekick and Bette Davis is charming as ever as his would-be love interest. The three make a fun pair, with McHugh handling the more overt comedy, leaving Powell to tackle the subtler material, which plays to both of their strengths.

Yes, there's a musical number, and a lot of gratuitous fashion sequences, but with a running time of only 78 minutes, it's all over pretty quick and the script's brisk pace keeps thing moving along nicely. Thus, if youâ€™re a fan of any of the leads, you'll probably enjoy Fashions of 1934, but others needn't bother.
