  A slicker–but no less resonant–version of the kind of movie Sam Peckinpah might have made with Steve McQueen.

Caan plays Frank, a Chicago-based professional safe cracker looking to retire and start a family with his new girlfriend, played by Weld. Needing one last big score to secure his financial future, Frank agrees to go to work for Leo, a powerful crime boss, who sets up a high-dollar diamond heist in LA. Frank and his crew take down the score, but when Leo reneges on their deal it sets up a violent confrontation between Frank and Leo’s crew. Michael Mann’s first film is effective, stylish thriller peppered with great performances and a very satisfying third act. It’s a slicker–but no less resonant–version of the kind of movie Sam Peckinpah might have made with Steve McQueen.
