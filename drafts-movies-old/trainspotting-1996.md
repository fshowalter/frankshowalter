Synopsis: An Edinburgh youth (Ewan McGregor) tries to break free of the heroin addiction and friends (Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller) holding him down.

Trainspotting is, at times, laugh out loud funny and, at other times, deeply disturbing. Often, it's both. Director Danny Boyle's film, based on Irvine Welsh's novel, is a visual and aural tour-de-force that immerses the viewer in the heroin-fueled world of Scotland's drug subculture, offering a raw, impartial look at the life and its consequences, all set to a throbbing, iconic soundtrack. It doesn't glamorize its characters or their lifestyle, but it doesn't crucify them either. 

Instead, it's a wild ride, full of razor-sharp dialog, honest performances, and more than a few moments of tear-inducing humor. Best of all, the film feels honest, unlike Boyle's later, but very similar, <a href="/browse/reviews/slumdog-millionaire-2008/">Slumdog Millionaire (2008)</a>, as it doesn't rely on a fairy-tale conceit to hold up its story. Granted, it's that very same honesty that makes Trainspotting less accessible, as its darker elements can be very disturbing, and the ending, while satisfying, is far from life-affirming.

But it's that honesty that makes the film so resonant. Some films gently move you and some films knock you on your ass. Trainspotting definitely falls into the latter category, but once you get past the shock, you'll find a biting look at society that holds up perfectly well 13 years later and one that's highly recommended.
