Synopsis: Bill Maher mocks the mythology and dogma of the world's leading religions.

Religulous is funny and frightening. Funny, because of the absurd things Maher's interview subject's say, frightening, because they really, truly, believe them. This isn't a film for everyone, as some will definitely find it offensive, blasphemous, repulsive etc... but it's worth nothing that this isn't a mean movie. Maher's position isn't one of anger but rather disappointment and frustration.

Maher isn't so much interested in disproving the existence of God, but rather in discrediting the mythology and dogma associated with the various major religions. To this end, he does a great job pointing out the contradictory and outlandish elements prevalent in each, as well as how more modern religions, like Scientology, have no choice but to one-up the old guard in the mythology department. It's an interesting case, made more so by some very well reasoned arguments from some unexpected sources.

The film's biggest problem is that it spends too much time on Maher by himself. The genius of Michael Moore's best film is that he lets his subjects tell the story and make all his points. Maher isn't so subtle. There are a lot of scenes with him monologuing in a car that, while entertaining, aren't nearly as insightful or funny as those with him and an Arkansas Senator, or a Vatican astronomer.

Still, this is an important movie, if only because of its willingness to question and criticize an institution so sacrosanct in American culture, and its ability to do so in such an entertaining manner.
