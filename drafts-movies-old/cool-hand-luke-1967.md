Synopsis: A man (Paul Newman), sent to a prison camp for drunkenly sawing off parking meters, refuses to conform and inspires others in the process.

Cool Hand Luke is a masterpiece of atmosphere, charisma, and storytelling. From the opening scene onward, director Stuart Rosenberg and cinematographer Conrad Hall evoke a vivid southern atmosphere. You can feel the humidity, taste the dust, and smell the grass. 

Populating this world is an amazing cast lead by Paul Newman in one of his many iconic roles. Each man disappears into his part, everyone believable, be it as a prisoner or jailer, and there isn't a weak link among them. 

But what really puts Cool Hand Luke over the edge is the storytelling. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is a work of efficient beauty, conveying volumes about the characters and their feelings through a minimum of exposition. Luke himself doesnâ€™t talk much, yet everything he says seems to carry a special weight. Contrast George Kennedy, who's character loves to talk but doesn't really <em>say</em> much. The story is short on plot but long on character, even though Luke himself remains something of an enigma. This of course, makes repeat viewings a treat as each provides an opportunity to read deeper into the character.

Cool Hand Luke is a must-see for everyone, as it's one of those rare moments when the stars align and the perfect performers sync up with the perfect crew to tell a great story. And if you've already seen it, see it again.
