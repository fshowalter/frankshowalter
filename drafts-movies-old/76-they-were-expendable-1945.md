Montgomery and Wayne are PT boat captains, trying to prove their unit's worth while defending the Philippines against the Japanese in World War II. Montgomery and Wayne are solid as the leads, Reed's suitably charming, and Wead's script wisely eschews a neat ending in favor of one that captures the uncertain nature of life during wartime. That said, Wead and Ford don't do enough to differentiate the individual crew members, who all seem to blend together causing their scenes to drag. Finally, Montgomery should never, ever, wear shorts in a film again.
