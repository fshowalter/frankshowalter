Synopsis: A private detective (William Powell) falls for the socialite he’s been hired to frame.

Private Detective 62, despite running only 67 minutes, feels like two movies.  The first half deals with Powell’s character trying to find work in Depression-era New York, while the second (and much less cogent) half deals with Powell working as a private investigator.

That’s not to say the film is bad.  The script plays to Powell’s strengths and, as such, allows him to carry the film, which he easily does.  While the second half can be a bit confusing (Just how was Margaret Lindsay’s character able to win so much money?), Powell is so charming it’s hard to care.

Bottom Line: Worth watch for Powell fans, just don’t expect too much in the way of explanations in the second half.
