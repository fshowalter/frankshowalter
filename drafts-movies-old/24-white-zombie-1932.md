Fun horror film bolstered by inventive visuals, a good performance from Lugosi, and a refreshingly edgy pre-code script. Set in Haiti, story concerns Charles Beaumont, a wealthy plantation owner who convinces a young couple to travel to his plantation to be married. Unbeknownst to to the couple, Beaumont has eyes for the bride-to-be and when his advances are rebuked, turns to the mysterious 'Murder' Legendre (Lugosi) for help. Soon, the woman becomes the titular white zombie under Legendre's control.

Lugosi's great as an ice-cold devil incarnate, and the script by Garnett Weston is a pre-code thing of efficient beauty, telling the story of a man driven by lust to make a deal with the devil, and wrapping it all up in just over an hour. Granted, the Hollywood ending is a bit of a cop-out (a slightly darker finale would have made this something great) but it's not a deal-breaker.
