Bogart plays a cynical veteran held hostage in a sweltering Florida hotel along with Bacall by deported gangster Robinson. Beneath the surface, Huston's crackling suspense drama explores post-war disillusionment in America, with Bogart wondering what he fought for and Robinson struggling to understand why everything can't be like it once was. Sentiment that's still topical today.
