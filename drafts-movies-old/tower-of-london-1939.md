Synopsis: Richard III (Basil Rathbone) murders his way to the throne of England with the help of his executioner, Mord (Boris Karloff).

Tower of London tries to be a bit of everything, but really succeeds at nothing.

First, it tries to be a political drama, yet the plot is so by the numbers, there’s little in the way of intrigue.  Further, Basil Rathbone’s Richard III is fairly dry, lacking the edge necessary to make him truly menacing.  Perhaps this was a concession to Karloff’s character, but whatever the cause, it hurts the film.

Tower of London also tries to be a gothic horror.  To some extent, it succeeds here, largely due to the presence of Boris Karloff, whose hulking executioner is a more than suitable boogeyman.  His performance, combined with the dungeon sets, gives the film a nice atmosphere.

Finally, Tower of London tries to be a swashbuckler, throwing in a couple of large-scale battle sequences to get the point across.  While these bits are okay, the choreography is a bit weak, and they don’t stir much in the way of emotion.

An interesting side note about the film is that Vincent Price, who has a supporting role as the Duke of Clarence, would later play the lead in <a href="/browse/reviews/tower-of-london-1962/" title="&#8220;Tower of London (1962)&#8221;">Roger Corman’s remake</a> 23 years later.

Bottom Line: Tower of London is a movie that probably looked very good on paper, but the actual execution leaves something to be desired.
