Nyqvist plays a recently disgraced investigative journalist recruited by an aging tycoon to investigate a 40-year-old murder. Rapace plays a young investigator with a troubled past who finds herself drawn to Nyqvist after investigating him. 

Much better than [the remake](/movies/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011), this version doesn't telegraph its plot points, has more satisfying ending, and includes a whole chunk of Rapace's backstory, all while clocking-in six minutes shorter. Sure, the performers aren't as glamorous, and the production values aren't as high, but this version's focus on the story--and not on building a franchise--makes it the one to see.
