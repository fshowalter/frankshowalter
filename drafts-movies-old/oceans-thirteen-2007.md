Synopsis: Danny Ocean (George Clooney) gets the gang back together after one of their own is betrayed by a ruthless casino owner (Al Pacino).

Ocean's Thirteen isn't so much a movie as it is a party that we've been invited to watch. Granted this is the third time around and some of the novelty's worn off, but all the players seem to be having a good time and the film goes out of its way to make things as easy as possible for the viewer.

Director Steven Soderbergh infuses the movie with his signature style, and even manages to sneak in some old Vegas nostalgia, which unfortunately, is the movie's only real substance.

And its the lack of substance that hurts the movie. While the performers are all very charming, the story isn't really <em>about</em> anything. It hints at the transient nature of Las Vegas, but the notion, like Ocean's crew, is there and gone before you know it.

Bottom Line: An entertaining pass-time, but nothing more.
