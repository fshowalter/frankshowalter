Robinson is a boxing promotor who discovers an unlikely prospect in a bellhop, played by Wayne Morris. Great boxing scenes and the strong turns from Robinson and Davis help to compensate for the unlikable Morris, though the costume designer's choices for Davis, including several veils and a fez, are something of a head-scratcher.
