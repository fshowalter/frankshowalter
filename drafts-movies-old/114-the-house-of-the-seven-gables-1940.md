With the family facing bankruptcy, Price convinces his elderly father to sell the titular family home, planning to use his share of the proceeds to marry his cousin, Lindsay, and move to New York, but brother Sanders is convinced the house has a treasure hidden within its walls, and frames Price for murder. The uninspired photography, route direction and unintentionally funny climax undermine the terrific performances from the three leads.
