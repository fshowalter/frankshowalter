Powell plays the titular patriarch, a bombastic New York businessman trying to adjust to the ever changing realities of his family and household. The sets and Technicolor production are nice, and Powell's conversation with the local Reverend, played by Edmund Gwenn, is a laugh-out-loud highlight, but the child actors and their various sub-plots are annoying, making for a film that feels overlong and trying at various points.
