Synopsis: A woman (Rachel Weisz) makes over her new boyfriend (Paul Rudd) leading to tension with his friends (Gretchen Mol and Fred Weller).

The Shape of Things joins writer/director Neil LaBute's previous films In the Company of Men (1997) and Your Friends & Neighbors (1998) as a scathing look at gender politics and relationships.  

This time around, he takes the simple premise of a pretty, outgoing girl transforming a shy, awkward ugly-duckling guy into a swan and turns it on its ear, exploring the motivations of the girl, the duck and his friends as well as their reactions to his transformation. Adapted by LaBute from his own play, there are only four characters in the entire film, but it packs a considerable punch and holds up well to repeat viewings, even after the big third act surprise is known.

As with LaBute's previous efforts, this one can be brutal. None of the characters are totally honest with everyone else, and only one is completely honest with themselves. The kicker though, is that, like LaBute's previous efforts, they're the only one that comes out of the film unhurt. It may not be a popular or reassuring sentiment, but it is an honest one and a large part of what makes The Shape of Things such a good film.
