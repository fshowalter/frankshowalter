Wayne plays an undercover singing cowboy sent by Washington to investigate Taylor, who's forcing ranchers off their land by charging excessively for water rights. The opening sequence with Wayne strumming a guitar on horseback while lip-synching a soundtrack ballad is laughable, but Yakima Canutt's stunt work (love that horse dive!) and a passable leading lady in Parker make this one of Wayne's better poverty row westerns.
