A fun mix of camp and horror, with Lee as a professor who comes to the aid of a colleague's son in danger of falling victim to a Medusa-like creature in a remote village. Cushing is the village doctor who seems to be covering something up. Lee doesn't make his appearance until the film is almost half over (leaving it to Michael Goodliffe to hold down the fort, which he does with aplomb), but his over-the-top cross between Sherlock Holmes and Van Helsing is a lot of fun (love the mustache!). Not as fun is the actual Gorgon, which is only scary if you fear bad special effects.
