<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780608/">Smiley Face</a>, the new stoner-comedy from Gregg Araki that played to standing-room-only crowds at this year’s Sundance, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1570507/20070925/story.jhtml">is going straight to DVD</a>.  Well, almost.  Distributor First Look will give it a one-theater run in LA that reeks of satisfying a contractual clause.

Compounding this is the fact the DVD won’t drop until January, almost a full year after its bravo showing in Sundance.  Wow, way to kill the buzz there, First Look.
