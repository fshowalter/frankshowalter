Wayne plays a cowboy G-Man who joins a medicine show to catch a gang of counterfeiters. Pierson recycles several of Yakima Canutt's stunts from studio Monogram's earlier oaters, including the famous horse dive, which, along with the Canutt choreographed fight scenes, make up the film's highlights, as the performances are universally poor, with the usually solid Wayne stumbling over his lines and never seeming entirely comfortable in his role.
