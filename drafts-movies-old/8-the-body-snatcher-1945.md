Karloff plays a ruthless cabman who supplies cadavers for Daniell. Second-billed Lugosi is just window-dressing in what would be his final on-screen pairing with Karloff. There's atmosphere in spades, but that can't overcome a talky script that drags whenever Karloff's off-screen for too long.  Further, thereâ€™s a whole subplot with a paralyzed little girl that fails miserably (the girl is downright annoying from the get-go), and a hinted-at romance that also seems misplaced. Given the talent involved, this should have been better.
