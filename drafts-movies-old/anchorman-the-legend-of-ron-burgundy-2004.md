Synopsis: Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), the top-rated local news anchor in 1970's San Diego, finds his world turned upside down when an ambitious female anchor (Christina Applegate) comes to town.

Anchorman is one of those rare movies that gets better with repeated viewings. You come across it late at night while flipping through the channels and inevitably watch it through to the end.

All the performances, especially cameos, are great, and director Adam McKay shows some real flair during the opening sequence that goes along way toward establishing the film's easy-going tone.

It's that same tone that's perhaps the movie's only weakness. It's pure bubble-gum with no real substance. Sure, it's entertaining, but it doesn't stay with you the way a truely great movie does.

Bottom Line: An entertaining ride, just don't look for much more.
