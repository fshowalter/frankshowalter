Synopsis: A fictionalized biography of producer Florenz Ziegfeld (William Powell).

The Great Ziegfeld works because of William Powell. His natural charisma and urbane demeanor are a natural fit for the character of Ziegfeld, a larger-than-life figure who went from carnival barker to Broadway producer, going broke several times in the process, but always dreaming of the next big show.

The shows themselves are impressive as well. The film features several production numbers that hold up even against modern standards, and must have been positively jaw dropping in 1936. 

The biggest problem with The Great Ziegfeld is Luise Rainer, who plays Ziegfeld's first wife, Anna Held. She over-acts every scene and does little to charm the audience. As a result, it's hard to understand what Powell's character sees in her, and when their marriage ultimately fails, it's not a tragedy; it's a relief. Of course, Rainer won an Oscar for her performance.

At three hours, The Great Ziegfeld is long, but it doesn't feel <em>too</em> long. While it certainly could be tighter, it doesn't drag as you might expect. The first half can be a little rough with Rainer's ham-fisted performance, but fortunately, Myrna Loy, who has ample chemistry with Powell, plays Ziegfeld's second wife and helps the movie finish strong, which ultimately keeps you from feeling burned.
