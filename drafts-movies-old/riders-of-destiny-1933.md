Synopsis: Sent from Washington, a singing cowboy (John Wayne) helps a group of ranchers dependent on a tyrant for water.

Riders of Destiny stumbles right out of the gate.  The opening sequence, John Wayne strumming a guitar on horseback while he badly lip-synchs a soundtrack ballad is almost laughable.  Later in the film, Wayne’s singing would either be off-screen, or with his back to the camera.  Given that, I can’t help but wonder why writer/director Robert N. Bradbury didn’t drop the singing angle all together.

Singing problems aside, there are also some ill-advised attempts at slapstick comedy involving some of the bad guy’s goons, and an all too complicated plot involving water rights. 

The only real highlights are some good stunt work (love that horse dive!) and John Wayne’s charisma.

Bottom Line: Fans of the genre will find it watchable, but a lip-synching John Wayne means others should steer clear.
