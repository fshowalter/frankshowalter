In 1941, aimless Irishman Mitchum drifts into the local contingent of the IRA, where he's sent on a raid meant to coincide with the Nazi invasion of England, but things don't go as planned. Tepid direction and a dull script that sees most character's actions dictated by the plot make this an exercise in tedium. The scenery could have helped, but Dade's black and white photography is as uninspired as the rest of the film.
