Ailing barrister Laughton defends Power, accused of murdering an older woman for her money, despite damning testimony from Power's wife, Dietrich. Though Christie's play packs a twist ending, Wilder's film doesn't rely on it to deliver the goods, instead leaning on Laughton, who carries the film with an iconic, tour-de-force performance. The supporting cast is great too, particularly Laughton's real-life wife Elsa Lanchester, who plays his nurse on screen. Their back-and-forth provides much of the film's comic relief and is still laugh-out-loud funny over fifty years later.
