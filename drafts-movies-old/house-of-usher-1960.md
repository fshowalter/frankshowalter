Synopsis: A man (Vincent Price) believes his family is cursed with madness as his house crumbles around him.

House of Usher was director <a href="/browse/roger-corman/">Roger Corman</a>’s first Poe adaptation and remains one of his finest.

<a href="/browse/vincent-price/">Vincent Price</a> is great in the title role of Roderick and since the film is set in America, the distinctly American accent of Mark Damon doesn’t detract from the movie.

The sets are fabulous and the script by Richard Matheson checks in at a lean 79 minutes.  While the first act can be a little slow to sit through, the great finale makes up for it, and actually improves on repeat viewings.

Bottom Line: Fans of Hammer Films and Vincent Price will love it; others should enjoy it as well.
