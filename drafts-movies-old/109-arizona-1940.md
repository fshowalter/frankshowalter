Drifter Holden helps "first American woman in Tucson" Arthur protect her freight line from Indians and conspirators. Though she looks great at 40, Arthur's "aw shucks" demeanor doesn't mesh with the film's gritty, dirty look, and neither does William's cartoonish villain, or Holden's cardboard good guy. Fortunately, the solid production values keep things afloat until the finale where, inexplicably, Arthur and William both tone it down Holden grows a pair to deliver a memorable ending.
