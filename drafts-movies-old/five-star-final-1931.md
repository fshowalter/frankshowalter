Synopsis: In an attempt to boost circulation, a newspaper editor (Edward G. Robinson) assigns an unscrupulous reporter (Boris Karloff) to a retrospective story on a scandalous, twenty-year-old murder.

Five Star Final may have garnered an Oscar nomination for best picture in 1932, but it doesn't hold up well today.  While the gross over emoting by much of the cast certainly doesn't help, the real problem is that its 1930's world is too far removed from the always-on, plugged-in, global world of today.  Granted, the underlying message of big media's incessant quest for higher ratings and great circulation is still relevant, later films such <a href="/browse/reviews/network-1976/">Network (1976)</a> have provided a more relatable execution.  

That said, while most of the cast is awful, Edward G. Robinson and Boris Karloff do manage to deliver a pair of great performances as a conflicted editor finding it harder and harder to face his own reflection, and a sly, devious, amoral, reporter respectively.  Their performances, along with Aline MacMahon as Robinson's character's secretary, make the movie watchable, but not worth going out of your way to catch.
