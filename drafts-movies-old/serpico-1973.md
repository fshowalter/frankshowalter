Synopsis: The true story of Frank Serpico (Al Pacino), a New York City cop who blew the whistle on rampant graft and corruption in the department, only to become alienated by his fellow officers.

From the piercing shrill of the opening siren, to the memorable closing shot, Serpico <em>feels</em> amazingly real. Director Sidney Lumet puts you right inside Serpico’s world. The gritty police station, the dirty streets, the tiny apartment, Lumet’s attention to detail is astounding.

Of considerable note is Pacino.  He manages to pull off a complex role with such subtlety that his slow descent into obsession is only really apparent after you’ve had time to reflect on the performance.

The script by Waldo Salt does a good job of telling a lot of story in a short time, while still maintaining a hell of a dramatic punch.  Granted, some of the characters are a little under-developed (like Serpico’s first girlfriend), but this isn’t a deal-breaker.

Bottom Line: A powerful performance in a great movie.  Recommended.
