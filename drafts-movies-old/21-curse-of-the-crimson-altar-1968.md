Eden travels to Lee's remote country estate in search of his missing brother. There he encounters a hippy orgy, a professor of the occult (Karloff), and the legend of Lavinia Morley, a witch killed 300 years prior. Lots of atmosphere, some over-the-top dream sequences replete with gratuitous nudity, and the always-solid Lee make this a guilty pleasure, especially with the gorgeous high-definition transfer.

Antiques dealer Robert Manning (Mark Eden) travels from London to Craxton Lodge, a remote country estate. His arrival coincides with a local festival celbrating the burning of the witch Lavidia some ? years earlier. The estate’s owner, Morely (Christopher Lee) doesn’t know anything about Manning’s brother,  but invites Manning to stay the night. Manning agrees, planning to go down to the local villiage the following day and make inquiries. 

Manning also meets another of the locals, Professor Marshe (Borris Karloff), who is something of an expert on witchcraft. 

That night, Manning is visited by strange dreams of a green skinnned woman who insists he sign his name in a book.

After my first viewing of _The Curse of the Crimson Altar_ (_The Crimson Cult_ here in the USA), I considered the film something of a guilty pleasure. The over-the-top dream sequences and gratuitous nudity were good for a chuckle. 

But watching it a second time, I found the film far less entertaining. Sure, watching Karloff prove he still had it even at eighty warms a movielover’s heart, but that’s about all the movie has going for it. Lee is fine in a role that doesn’t give him much to do, but Barbara Steele is wasted. The stories mystery elements, already weak on the first viewing border on tedious the second time around.

Given that it was Karloff’s final film, it’s probably required viewing for any serious fan of classic horror. 

While _The Curse of the Crimson Altar_ isn’t a disaster, given the cast, it does rank as a significant dissappointment.
