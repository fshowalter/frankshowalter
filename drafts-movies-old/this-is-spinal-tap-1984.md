Synopsis: A filmmaker (Rob Reiner) chronicles the gradual demise of a British heavy metal band in the early 80s.

This is Spinal Tap is an excellent send up of not only the heavy metal genre, but of the music industry and even the documentary format.

Writers Michael McKean and Christopher Guest double as the leads, and are both believable and entertaining as the contentious band mates, and their script is littered with subtle gags that make the film hold up well to repeat viewings.

The only real weakness is that, even at 82 minutes, the movie feels a bit long.  Like most parodies, sustaining them is the hardest part and this one almost succeeds.

Bottom Line: A classic that virtually defined the “mockumentary” genre. Recommended.
