Synopsis: A businessman (Cary Grant) proposes an affair to a virtuous secretary (Doris Day) who is more interested in marriage.

That Touch of Mink is a lighthearted comedy that coasts along on the charisma of its two leads. 

While the script won’t leave you in stitches, it’s low-key enough to stay out of the way as Grant and Day charm the audience.  Director Delbert Mann subscribes to the same philosophy, framing his stars well and letting them do what they do best.  His decision to film Doris Day in soft focus was overkill though, as she still looked great at 38 (and at least somewhat believable as a romantic interest for Grant, who was 58). 

The supporting cast doesn’t disappoint either.  Gig Young is great as Grant’s would-be conscience and Audrey Meadows steals all of her scenes as Day’s overprotective roommate.

Bottom Line: Fans of the leads, or romantic comedies, won’t be disappointed.
