Rodeo star Wayne and his gambler buddy, played by Eddy Chandler,  track down pair of robbers after finding themselves accused of the crime. Granted, Parsons' script is based around the Monogram staple of mistaken identity that puts the Duke at odds with the law, but this is a different Duke then we’re used to seeing. Early on, he pulls a gun on a cashier to ensure he gets his promised share of the prize pool, even though it’ll likely bankrupt the rodeo, and later he’s shooting at the posse that believes him guilty of armed robbery and murder. In between, he even beats up his buddy and blatantly ogles women. Complimenting the edgier Wayne is a superior supporting cast, with Chandler holding his own opposite the young Duke, Fix doing a good job as head baddie Al Ferguson’s reluctant partner, and Kornman providing ample charm as Wayne’s romantic lead.
