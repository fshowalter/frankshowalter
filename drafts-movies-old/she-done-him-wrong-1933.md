Synopsis: A saloon owner (Mae West) juggles a slew of men including a missionary (Cary Grant).

She Done Him Wrong is the film adaptation of Mae West’s play Diamond Lil.  Unfortunately, it falls victim to the same fate of her later effort <a href="/browse/reviews/im-no-angel-1933/">I’m No Angel (1933)</a>, namely it doesn’t age well.  

While She Done Him Wrong was no doubt scandalous in 1933, it’s positively tame by today’s standards.  In the post-feminist era, the idea of a sexually liberated woman is no longer shocking.  Indeed, looking through a modern eye, the supposed chemistry between West and Grant is hardly believable.

That aside, the script does move well, especially in the film’s last 20 minutes, and the 66-minute running time keeps things from getting too stale.  Further, there’s a solid performance from Cary Grant, even though he looks oddly lanky in that black missionary costume.

Bottom Line: While Mae West fans will no doubt enjoy it, others should look elsewhere.
