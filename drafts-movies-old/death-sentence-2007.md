Synopsis: After his son is killed by a street gang, an executive (Kevin Bacon) sets out for revenge.

Death Sentence is a frustrating movie. Director James Wan delivers a visually stylish film, but doesn’t seem to trust his own storytelling ability.  Repeatedly, Wan does a great job of <em>showing</em> us things in a very economical manner only to then have a character <em>tell</em> us the very same thing.  Chopping ten to fifteen minutes off the running time (and maybe losing a character or two) would have gone a long way toward making this a much tighter, and better, movie.

Still, none of this should overshadow the excellent performance by Kevin Bacon, who never overplays his character’s slow, moral death and delivers a very economical performance that should have been the absolute focus of the movie.  Instead, Wan meanders along with several other peripheral characters much to the film’s detriment.

Bottom Line: While it’s worth a look, given the premise and the great performance by Bacon, this should have been a much better movie.
