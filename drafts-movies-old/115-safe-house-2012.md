Reynolds is a young CIA agent with little field experience stuck manning a never-used safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The plot kicks in when the house is compromised after rogue agent Washington is placed in his charge. The cast is solid, and Espinosa does a good impersonation of Tony Scott, but almost everything about this film feels recycled, right down to the third-act twist, making the Cape Town locations the only original contribution, and that's just not enough.
