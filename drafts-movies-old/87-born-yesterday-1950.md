Burly scrap-metal tycoon Crawford is trying to buy influence in Congress when he realizes that his showgirl girlfriend Holliday's low-brow manner may be a liability, so he pays D.C. newsman Holden to make her couth. It's Holliday’s movie and though she's grating at first, she quickly warms you over with genuine charm and charisma. Opposite her, Crawford does a wonderful job playing a bear of a man who’s a crook and doesn’t even realize it, and Holden is solid in a role that would have been perfect for a younger Jimmy Stewart.

Mannheimer's script (with revisions by playwright Kanin) opens grounded in a very real-world cynicism, then gradually morphs into a fantasy, with the ending being downright outlandish, yet Cukor makes the change with such subtly, you don’t realize it until long after the film’s over.
