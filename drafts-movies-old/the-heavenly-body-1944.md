Synopsis: An astronomer (William Powell) discovers his wife (Hedy Lamarr) plans to leave him for an air-raid warden (James Craig) because her astrologist told her it was destined to happen.

The Heavenly Body marked another pairing of William Powell and Hedy Lamarr. The two had previously teamed for Powell's previous film, <a href="/browse/reviews/crossroads-1942/">Crossroads (1942)</a>. This time around, Lamarr has a much bigger role, with disastrous results.

The film is meant to be a comedy but, aside from one or two lines from Powell, really isn't funny. Nor is it particularly romantic, as Lamarr, despite frequently being referred to at the time as "the most beautiful woman in the world,"  is so utterly uncharming that twenty minutes into the picture you're crying out for Powell's character to leave this crazy loon. Further, at 95 minutes, the film's nearly a half-hour too long. 

Once explanation for the film's shortcomings, according to the IMDb is that director Alexander Hall, who was on loan from Columbia, had to leave before production finished to direct <a href="/browse/reviews/once-upon-a-time-1944/">Once Upon a Time (1944)</a>. Vincente Minnelli apparently took over as director for the last 3 weeks. 

Whatever the cause, The Heavenly Body is a mess that's worth a look only for die-hard Powell or Lamarr fans.
