Peckinpah's first meditation on the changing west has Scott and McCrea giving career performances as a pair of aged gunfighters transporting gold while trying to reconcile how the world has passed them by. The ending (which, according to the IMDb, Peckinpah rewrote himself) takes a good movie and makes it great. Incidentally, Scott would retire after this film, saying that he'd never be able to better his performance and wanted to go out on top.
