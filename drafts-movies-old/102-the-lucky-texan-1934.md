Wayne and his old-timer partner, played by Gabby Hayes, strike gold, but find themselves wanted for murder thanks to crooked assayer Whitlock. Bradbury's script is slow and talky with a lot of setup getting Wayne and Hayes together and into the mining business. The flat attempts at comedy, laughable Lassie sequence, and Sheldon's wooden performance as Wayne's love interest don't help, but despite all of that, the last ten minutes are great, featuring a laugh-out-loud sequence involving Hayes disguising himself in drag.
