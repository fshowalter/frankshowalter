During World War II, Bogart leads a group of patriotic French convicts who escape from Devil's Island in order to join the fight to free France from the Nazis. Good production and a memorable turn by Sydney Greenstreet can't overcome a script that's all over the place, nesting flashbacks within flashbacks and insisting that we accept Bogie as a Frenchman. The inevitable comparisons to Casablanca only hurt this mediocre melodrama.
