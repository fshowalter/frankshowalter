Facing Indians on the war path, Mitchum, his young son, and saloon girl Monroe head down the titular river on a large raft after Monroe's no-good gambler fiancee steals their only rifle and horse. Uneven, half-hearted effort from Preminger is enjoyable as an adventure, but struggles when it shifts to melodrama. Fortunately, LaShelle's great scope photography compensates.
