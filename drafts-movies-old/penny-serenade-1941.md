Synopsis: A couple (Cary Grant and Irene Dunne) endures a series of tragedies as they attempt to start a family.

Penny Serenade is an uneven melodrama that features one of Cary Grant’s most memorable monologues.

Framed by the novel device of Irene Dunne’s character remembering her troubled marriage while playing different records, Penny Serenade has potential.  Dunne and Grant are both solid (even if it is a bit odd to see Grant romancing the older Dunne) as are supporting players Beulah Blondi and Edgar Buchanan and the production values are top-notch, especially the wholly believable earthquake sequence.

Unfortunately, while the script by Morrie Ryskind avoids the temptation to devolve into a simple tearjerker, it can’t seem to make up its mind about exactly what story it’s trying to tell.  Is this the story about a couple’s attempt to have a child or a story about a marriage torn apart by money?  Ryskind spreads himself too thin, even for a two hour running time, and the result is a story that fails to resonate.

Not helping are the little touches that director George Stevens seems to miss.  For example, when Grant and Dunne’s infant baby rouses them from bed, Grant’s hair is perfect, and his face is clean-shaven.  This artificiality, along with the weak attempts at physical comedy, undermines the story’s dramatic efforts.

Despite these flaws, Penny Serenade is worth watching for Cary Grant fans, if only for the impassioned monologue in which he argues for custody of his adopted daughter.  Easily the highlight of the film, Grant’s performance is those few minutes is more emotionally effecting than the entire rest of the film put together.

Bottom Line: While Penny Serenade may be worth a look for fans of Cary Grant, who delivers one of his more memorable performances, those not fond of tinny melodramas should look elsewhere.
