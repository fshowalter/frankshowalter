Powell is ill-cast as an English officer who, upon arrival for duty in Ireland, rekindles an affair with the wife (Best) of his old friend (Clive). He's certainly charming enough, but the film's uneven tone leaves him looking lost, and the tired romantic triangle is far less interesting than the political backdrop.
