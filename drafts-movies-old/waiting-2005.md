Synopsis: The employees of a chain restaurant ponder their lives and their futures.

Waiting is a frustrating movie. In front of the camera you have a great cast,  but they’re working with a script by writer/director Rob McKittrick that just isn’t funny. That the movie is even watchable is a testament to the charisma of the cast, particularly Ryan Reynolds who has a real gift for comedic timing, but can’t seem to catch a break script-wise.

Bottom Line: In many ways, Waiting is a movie begging to be written by Kevin Smith. In fact, he did write it a couple of years later as Clerks 2.  Watch it instead.
