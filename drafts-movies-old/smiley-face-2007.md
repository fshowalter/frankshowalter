Synopsis: After unwittingly eating an entire plate of pot cupcakes, an actress (Anna Farris) finds herself at the center of several misadventures.

Smiley Face <a href="/browse/commentary/2007/10/01/smiley-face-gets-dumped-to-dvd/">deserved better</a>.  Director Gregg Araki’s film is refreshingly funny, and features an award worthy performance from Anna Faris.  While it may not have broken box office records, a small run in college towns would have built a strong cult following.

Dylan Haggerty’s script is a mix of stoner humor, screwball comedy, and genuine inspiration; a tone he establishes perfectly in the film’s opening scene.  Further, at only 88 minutes Smiley Face acknowledges that it’s more or less a one-joke movie, and doesn’t wear out its welcome, thus ensuring a high replay value.

For her part, Faris carries the film with ease.  It’s a tricky proposition, as her character could easily come across as self-absorbed and lose the audience’s sympathy, but Faris walks the line, winning you over from the very first scene.

Bottom Line: Smiley Face isn’t a touching film, or one with a resounding message, it’s 88 minutes of inspired insanity that takes its rightful place alongside Harold and Kumar, Beer Fest, and other great “party” movies.
