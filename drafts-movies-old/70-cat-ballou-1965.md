After a vicious gunman, played by Marvin, kills her father, schoolmarm Fonda turns outlaw and recruits the gunman's drunken twin brother, also played by Marvin, in her quest for revenge. Sure, some of the gags fall flat in this western satire, but Marvin's great his dual role, Fonda couldn't be more charming, and Nat 'King' Cole provides a catchy soundtrack.
