Synopsis: A Civil War colonel (John Wayne) tracks down stolen gold, and helps a group of townsfolk stand up to a corrupt sheriff.

Rio Lobo has enough story for several movies.  It starts out as a Civil War picture, morphs into something of a mystery, then finally settles into a condensed remake of director Howard Hawks’ earlier film, <a href="/browse/reviews/rio-bravo-1959/">Rio Bravo (1959)</a>.

Coasting through all this is the film’s star, John Wayne.  Despite his considerable charisma, Wayne seems a little too old for the role.  Maybe it’s because we’ve already seen him play the role twice before and can’t help but remember the younger Wayne, but whatever the cause, the film suffers because of it.

That aside, Rio Lobo is an enjoyable movie.  Hawks does a solid job behind the camera, and the supporting cast holds their own well enough.

Bottom Line: Worth watching for Wayne fans, others should watch <a href="/browse/reviews/rio-bravo-1959/">Rio Bravo (1959)</a> instead.
