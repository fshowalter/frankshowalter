On the Trans-Siberian Express, Anthropologist Lee transports a frozen fossil he believes might be the missing link, but the locals believe is some kind of devil. Along for the ride is rival Anthropologist Cushing, who's itching to get a look at Lee's discovery, especially after people start dying. There are several ridiculous side-plots in this pseudo-remake of The Thing from Another World (1951), but the fun special effects (love those white eyes) and the novelty of Lee and Cushing playing allies make this a guilty pleasure.
