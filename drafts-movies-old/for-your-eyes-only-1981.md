Synopsis: After one of their nuclear subs is attacked and sunk, the British government sends in secret agent James Bond (Roger Moore) to recover a critical hardware device capable of controlling their nuclear missiles.

For Your Eyes Only, the twelfth entry in the long-running James Bond franchise, is the best to date, narrowly edging out <a href="/browse/reviews/goldfinger-1964/">Goldfinger (1964)</a>. It's a back-to-basics spy thriller, replete with plot twists and double-crosses, all beautifully shot and punctuated with some great action sequences.

The genius here is how the script keeps up the tension throughout the entire film. Right from the opening sequence, Bond is constantly under attack, and constantly trying to figure out just who's attacking him. This momentum keeps the story moving along and helps the big set pieces feel more organic.

Indeed, the film's few missteps are minor. Bill Conti's score isn't as elegant as John Barry's, and the use of wah-wah guitars during the big ski sequence only serve to date the film. Also, Carole Bouquet isn't quite the actress she needs to be, particularly during the close-up after an assault on her parent's boat, which comes across as unintentionally funny.

But these are minor quibbles. For Your Eyes Only is a great combination of thriller and adventure, with a minimum of camp, making it a must-see for Bond fans. While it may lack Sean Connery, it's better in every other aspect.
