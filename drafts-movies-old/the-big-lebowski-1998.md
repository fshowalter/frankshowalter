Synopsis: A case of mistaken identity puts a slacker (Jeff Bridges) in the middle of a kidnapping case involving a millionaire’s wife.

The Big Lebowski is the Coen Brothers' quasi-remake of Howard Hawk’s The Big Sleep (1946) only, instead of a hard-boiled Humphrey Bogart, we’ve got a slacker named “The Dude,” portrayed perfectly by Jeff Bridges.

But the story is little more than an excuse to deconstruct the hard-boiled detective, much the same way that Robert Altman did in The Long Goodbye (1973), only with even more irreverence.

The supporting cast is great, and the film is littered with so many in-jokes and self-references that you’re sure to find something new with every viewing.  Unfortunately this self-reference is one of The Big Lebowski’s few flaws, as it keeps the film from being as accessible as it could be.  The Big Lebowski has a learning curve that can be steep. 

Bottom Line: While some will no doubt be turned off by the language or lazy plot, if you look deeper there’s a real gem here.  Recommended.
