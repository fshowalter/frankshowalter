Synopsis: During World War I, a RAF pilot (Fredric March) becomes increasingly unhinged by the brutality of war while his co-pilot (Cary Grant) hungers for glory.

The Eagle and the Hawk is a surprisingly effective anti-war film highlighted by a strong performance from Fredric March, a solid performance from Cary Grant, and a script that paints anything but the typical Hollywood version of war at the time.

March is believable in his role as an initially cavalier pilot who, after being exposed to real combat, has a change of heart. Running contrary to his emotions are the adulations showered upon him as he completes mission after mission while simultaneously losing co-pilot after co-pilot. It's a complex part that could easily be overdone, but March handles it well.

Grant is less resonant opposite March. Credit the script for not painting his character as a one-dimensional warmonger, but Grant still has much less to work with than March, until the film's finale.

Carole Lombard even turns up in a throwaway supporting role. She's pretty, but unmemorable.

But in the end, it's The Eagle and the Hawk's script that puts it over the top. Rather than water-down its subject matter or wrap things up with an artificial ending, the screenwriters let their dark portrait reach its organic conclusion, resulting in a bittersweet finale that feels powerful but evenhanded. This isn't a great film, but it is an interesting one that will probably entertain film buffs more than those drawn by Cary Grant's name on the credits. Just don't go in expecting your typical war film.
