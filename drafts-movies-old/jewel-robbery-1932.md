Synopsis: In Vienna, a baroness (Kay Francis) falls for a debonair jewel thief (William Powell). 

Jewel Robbery is insane. William Powell plays a thief who, after robbing people of their valuables, gives them marijuana cigarettes to stone them into supplication. By the time the cops arrive, everyone is giggle happy and Powell and company are long gone. Ah, you've gotta love pre-code Hollywood. 

The rest of the film is a fairly fun romance between Powell and Kay Francis, who was apparently regarded as quite stunning at the time, but comes across as a bit odd now. Not homely, but certainly not the stunning beauty the script would lead you to believe.

For his part, Powell is perfect. All smooth charm and subtle innuendo, he makes the film by charming not only Francis, but the entire audience as well. It's a performance that would echo in Cary Grant's later turn in Alfred Hitchcock's <a href="/browse/reviews/to-catch-a-thief-1955/">To Catch a Thief (1955)</a>, but Powell does it better here.

There isn't a whole lot of plot in Jewel Robbery but, at only 70 minutes, it doesn't matter. The film exits gracefully before it wears out its welcome making for a thoroughly enjoyable film that's well worth a look.
