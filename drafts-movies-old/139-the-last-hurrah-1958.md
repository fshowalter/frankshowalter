Tracy plays an aging Irish-American political boss enduring a bitter, hard-fought campaign for reelection as mayor of a New England town. Nugent's script dramatizing the workings of a political machine grabs your attention from scene one, while Lawton Jr.'s crisp black and white photography gives the proceedings an extra gravitas. The film's only misstep comes with Tracy's final line, which serves no purpose other than to undercut the scene's (and the film's) dramatic impact.
