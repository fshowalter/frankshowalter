Synopsis: The chairman (Richard Boone) of a local cemetery believes he has the power to kill by switching pins on a plot chart.

I Bury the Living is somewhat of a surprise.  Despite a shoestring budget and a lead actor usually regulated to supporting roles, director Albert Band delivers a smart, atmospheric thriller that almost goes the distance.

The entire film feels like a good, albeit extended, episode of The Twilight Zone.  Much of the action takes place in the darkened office of an old cemetery, which goes a long way toward both keeping costs down and building atmosphere.

Adding to that atmosphere is some great indoor cinematography, especially in the film’s final third.  While most of the outdoor day-for-night shots are frustratingly bad, the use of light and shadow inside the cemetery office is masterful.

Without any real special effects budget, much of the film’s success rides on lead actor Richard Boone, who carries the film well.  His cool, understated performance perfectly suits a role that could easily have been overdone. 

Unfortunately, in the end, I Bury the Living collapses under its own premise.  The script by Louis Garfinkle does such a good job piling on the tension that the somewhat abrupt conclusion feels like a letdown.  That and a couple of almost cartoonish transition effects are the film’s only real weak points. 

Bottom Line: If you’re a fan of The Twilight Zone give this one a shot. Just forgive the ending.
