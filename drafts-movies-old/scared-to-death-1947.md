Synopsis: From the morgue, a woman's corpse recounts the events leading to her death involving a hypnotist (Bela Lugosi), a doctor (George Zucco), and a cop.

Scared to Death is notable as the only color film staring Bela Lugosi.  Unfortunately, that’s about all it’s notable for, as the film is comically bad.

How bad?  Well, Lugosi plays a cape-wearing hypnotist with a midget sidekick while what appears to be a renegade member Blue Man Group stalks around looking ominously through windows.  Now, the Blue Man isn’t the least bit scary, but you know it’s supposed to be ominous because of the music cues.

And speaking of those cues, it’s as if the filmmakers were trying to compensate for the story’s total lack of suspense by inserting dramatic music cues at every possible moment. 

Fortunately, Scared to Death is so bad it’s actually watchable.  The rather convoluted plot does keep you at least mildly interested, and the sheer absurdity of it all makes it easy to chuckle through the 65-minute running time, despite the stagy production and stiff acting.

Bottom Line: As the only color film to feature Bela Lugosi in a starring role, Scared to Death may be of interest to Lugosi fans, but others should steer clear.
