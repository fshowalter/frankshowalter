Archeologist Cushing and his chums discover a lost city in the desert ruled by an immortal queen, played by Andress. Despite her top billing, the film works best before Andress even gets on screen, with the early Arabian mystery and the surprisingly well produced desert exploration scenes serving as highlights. Once Andress does show up, however, the mystery and adventure vanish, replaced with predictable, stilted melodrama that wastes the talents of Cushing and strong supporting players Christopher Lee and Andr√© Morell.
