Synopsis: A widowed college professor (Dennis Quaid) copes with the unexpected arrival of his adopted brother (Thomas Haden Church) and a new romance.

Smart People is like As Good as It Gets (1997) meets Wonder Boys (2000), but unfortunately not as good as the sum of its parts.  The performers are all fine, but you can’t help but get the feeling that you’ve seen this all before.

Dennis Quaid tries so hard in the lead, and succeeds in creating a well-rounded, albeit totally unlikable character.  Again, imagine Jack Nicholson’s character from As Good as It Gets, or Michael Douglas’ from Wonder Boys, with significantly less charm and charisma.  This isn’t a knock on Quaid, who’s convincing, but more on director Noam Murro who failed to shape Quaid’s performance.

The same can be said of Sarah Jessica Parker and Ellen Page.  Black comedies are tricky, requiring just the right tone and approach, and Murro doesn’t find it here.

The saving grace is Thomas Haden Church.  Not only does he get all the best lines, but Church also manages to convey a genuine sense of charisma.  On paper, his character’s just as flat as the others, but Church actually makes us care about him, and in doing so, saves the film.

Bottom Line: Smart People covers the same ground as As Good as It Gets (1997) and Wonder Boys (2000), but unfortunately lacks the charm of the former and the style of the latter.
