Synopsis: A teenage girl (Jennifer Connelly) travels to a magical land to save her baby brother from the Goblin King (David Bowie).

Labyrinth is an ambitious, albeit flawed, fantasy film.  Director Jim Henson blends puppets and human actors to create a living, breathing fairy tale.  Unfortunately, he also seems trapped by the fairy tale genre.

The script by Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame) is funny, but not anywhere near as edgy as it should be.  There’s a lot of potential here, and the first half of the movie works well as it contrasts Connelly’s refusal to abandon the dreams of her youth with the harsh realities of growing up. This all comes to a head in a dark, allegory-laden scene involving a piece of fruit.  But after this, the movie shifts gears and devolves into an average fantasy-adventure piece with a happy singsong ending which, while no doubt kid pleasing, feels tacked-on and hallow.

Also, while most of Labyrinth remains charming twenty years after its release, some aspects of the film don’t age as well.  David Bowie’s teased hair and spandex are laughable now, and the gorgeous matte paintings can’t help but pale in an age of CGI.

Still, Henson deserves much credit for dreaming up some wonderful characters, and engraving “The Bog of Eternal Stench” on the minds of a generation.

Bottom Line: If you grew up with it, you’ll still enjoy it, but others may prefer either the Dark Crystal (if you’re a fan of Henson) or Time Bandits (if you’re a fan of Python) instead.
