Synopsis: A barbarian (Arnold Schwarzenegger) seeks revenge on the cult that slaughtered his people.

Conan the Barbarian is a violent adult fantasy that positively drips testosterone. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as the titular character.  He delivers a believable mix of savagery mixed with naivety that perfectly suits the role.  Additionally, his muscular physique and innate charisma help him command a huge screen presence. 

The supporting cast is equally well chosen.  Sandahl Bergman’s toned build and tough exterior server her well as Conan’s love interest, a strong warrior molded in the image of his mother, while James Earl Jones’ deep voice lends an extra air of believability to his performance as a sinister cult leader.

As a character, Conan is pure testosterone.  He steals, fights and carouses, taking whatever he wants, be it life or property, with no apologies or remorse.  He’s the ultimate alpha-male.  Yet the script by director John Milius and Oliver Stone is more than a glorified teenage fantasy.  Through a hodgepodge of several of Robert E. Howard’s stories, it explores what makes a man what he is, as well as the emptiness inherit in revenge, all punctuated by Basil Poledouris’ thunderous, and oft-imitated, musical score.

Bottom Line: A great fantasy picture that defines its genre.  Recommended.
