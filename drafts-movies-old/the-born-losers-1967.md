Synopsis: A part-Indian cowboy battles a ruthless gang of bikers in a small town.

Watching The Born Losers you'd be hard pressed to believe its sequel, Billy Jack, would go on to gross millions of dollars. Aside from what was, at the time, pretty graphic violence, and lots of shots of girls in their underwear there isn't a lot to recommend.

The lead character, Billy Jack, played by writer director Tom Laughlin really doesn't have much screen presence, the script meanders, and the supporting case overacts left and right.

Still, the movie does tap into the building frustration of the American psychosis that would later erupt in such films as Dirty Harry and Death Wish, as in doing so, does leave you with something. Just not a whole lot.

Bottom Line: This ground's been covered by better movies.
