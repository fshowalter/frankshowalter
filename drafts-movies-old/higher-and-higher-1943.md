Synopsis: A bankrupt man joins his valet (Jack Haley) in a scheme to pose his maid (Michèle Morgan) as his daughter in a bid to marry her off to rich man.

Higher and Higher is notable as Frank Sinatra's first credited role in a motion picture. Prior to this, his Hollywood résumé consisted of musical numbers in other star's films. Granted, in this film, he still plays "Frank Sinatra," but at least it's a fictionalized version of himself in which he gets to do a bit of acting, with dialog and everything. For this reason, Higher and Higher will be worth a look for die-hard Sinatra fans, but they would do well to keep the fast-forward button within reach.

Lead Michèle Morgan, a French actress whose accent slips more and more as the film goes on, lacks both charm and presence. She never seems comfortable with the screwball comedy, and the film really drags when it's hers to carry. Opposite her, Jack Haley is better, but only just.

Despite the film being billed as "The Sinatra Show," the 27-year-old Sinatra's role is little more than an extended cameo. It's a real shame as he outshines both Morgan and Haley from his first scene and is clearly capable of carrying the film, unlike its "stars."
