Synopsis: A reserved man (Paul Rudd) who has no male friends meets a free-spirited buddy (Jason Segal) who helps him open up.

I Love You, Man is a solid comedy thanks in large part to its stellar cast. Paul Rudd has settled nicely as a solid straight-man, leaving Jason Segal free to showcase his comedic range as Rudd's free-spirited buddy, something he couldn't do in his starring turn in <a href="/browse/reviews/forgetting-sarah-marshall-2008/">Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)</a>. The two men have a great, believable, chemistry and both manage to portray flawed men that you nonetheless come to care about, so much so, that you'd have either for a friend yourself.

Yet, as good as Rudd and Segal are, the supporting cast gets some of the strongest laughs. J.K. Simmons steals all of his scenes as Rudd's blunt, deadpan, father, Jaime Pressly and Jon Favreau make a delightfully dysfunctional couple, Andy Samberg brings his usual offbeat, low-key humor to his role as Rudd's gay brother, Thomas Lennon has a memorable turn as one of Rudd's "man dates", and Lou Ferrigno does a delightful send-up of himself.

I Love You, Man is a hard movie to dislike. The script by director John Hamburg and Larry Levin does leave a few threads dangling, but there's a genuine warmth below the humor that makes it endearing. That, combined with the great performances, makes it an easy recommendation.
