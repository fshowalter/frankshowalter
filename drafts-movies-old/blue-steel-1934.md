Synopsis: A sheriff (Gabby Hayes) and a man (John Wayne) help homesteaders beset by outlaws.

Blue Steel is one of the more entertaining Lone Star productions.  The pairing of John Wayne and Gabby Hayes is always enjoyable, but the decision to elevate Hayes’ role to sheriff, instead of his usual slot as a homesteader or miner, pays dividends.

Opposite Wayne and Hayes are Edward Peil Sr. as the chief baddie, and the always-entertaining Yakima Canutt as his top henchman. 

Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the Lone Star productions, Wayne’s leading lady leaves much to be desired.  Eleanor Hunt not only looks totally out of place, but she has zero charisma and absolutely no chemistry with John Wayne.

While the script by writer/director Robert N. Bradbury may be a little weak on logic (I love how the bad guys never yell for help when Wayne lassos them), it moves so fast you’ll barely notice or care.  Wayne and Hayes’ charisma, combined with several of Yakima Canutt’s great stunts make the 54-minute running time fly by.

Bottom Line: As far as Wayne’s Lone Star westerns go, Blue Steel ranks as one of the best, but ultimately this is still a B-Grade production.
