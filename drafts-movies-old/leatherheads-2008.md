Synopsis: In the early days of pro football, a desperate player (George Clooney) recruits a college star, unaware that a reporter (Renée Zellweger) is planning an unpleasant expose.

Leatherheads is a breezy, lightweight comedy that works thanks to the charisma of its leads.

While the film’s opening scenes might lead to you expect a quirky comedy ala the Coen Brothers, director/star George Clooney’s film lacks the Coen’s trademark eccentricity, but also lacks their dark undercurrents as well.  This is a throwback to the carefree comedies of the 30’s where you know full well that everything’s going to work out in the end, and all you need do is sit back and enjoy the ride.

And a nice ride it is.  Leatherheads actually one-ups the “screwball” comedies that inspired it by making each of its principal leads likable and, do some degree, relatable.  This goes a long way to improving repeat viewings, as each of the characters comes across as very engaging.

Granted, the film’s not perfect.  At almost two hours, it’s a little long, and while Renée Zellweger does her best Barbara Stanwyck impression, her chirpy voice lacks the throatiness necessary to really nail the part.  Still, even though she’s the weak link in the chain, her innate charisma carries her through.

Bottom Line: Leatherheads is a fun piece of fluff that will likely improve on each viewing.  Recommended.
