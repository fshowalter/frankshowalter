Wayne is cowboy tracking his parents' killer, played by Earl Dwire as a "half-white, half-Apache posing as a Mexican," only to find himself mistaken for a member of Dwire's gang by dim-witted sheriff Rockwell. It's an editing mess with Wayne pursuing Dwire through the forest in one shot, only to cut to the middle of the desert in the next, not to mention a good portion of the plot hinges on a Scooby-Doo like secret passage. It's only redeeming qualities are Wayne, Gabby Hayes and Yakima Canutt's stunt work, though it does recycle the horse dive from Riders of Destiny (1933).
