<cite>The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse</cite> features Edward G. Robinson as the titular doctor, a society physician secretly investigating criminal behavior by committing jewel heists then collecting data about his physical state of being, such as blood pressure and heart rate, with plans to publish his results for the good of mankind. 

When the good doctor finds that he needs a larger sample group, he assumes the identity of "The Professor" and hooks up with a fence, Jo, played by Claire Trevor. He quickly assumes control of her gang of thieves, much to the chagrin of former leader, and all-around tough guy 'Rocks' Valentine, played by Humphrey Bogart.

Soon, the doctor finds himself in deeper and deeper as Rocks tries to reassert control of the gang and the doctor struggles to keep his dual identities a secret.

Ostensibly, the filmmakers play the story as a straight Warner gangster picture, playing to the strengths of stars Robinson and Bogart, but beneath the surface, screenwriters John Wexley and John Huston craft a nice black comedy with Robinson as mad scientist. 

Though most of Warners' attempts to mix the gangster genre wound up as disasters (see <cite>The Return of Dr. X</cite>) this one works. While <cite>The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse</cite> certainly suffers from a rather unfortunate title, the crackling dialog (likely the work of Huston) and fast-paced direction make it an enjoyable ride.
