Synopsis: A corrupt casino owner (Humphrey Bogart) draws the ire of an outlaw (James Cagney) after framing the town’s founder for murder.

The Oklahoma Kid is most notable as the western with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.  Despite the fact that both are clearly better suited to more urban locales, both Cagney and Bogey acquit themselves well.

Granted Cagney doesn't "look the part" as well as Bogart. His eye makeup –visible in several scenes– and overall smooth appearance just don't mesh with the dirt and grime of a western, but his charisma, and the story's rapid pace, distract the viewer from these shortcomings. 

Given Bogart's considerable talent and oft-overlooked range, it's not surprising that he does a great job here as the classic western villain.  Complete with full-black outfit and villain name (Whip McCord) Bogart commands attention on screen despite a paper-thin characterization.

Despite a surprisingly brutal twist, the script is pretty much by-the-numbers fare, but that doesn't stop it from being entertaining, as the plot moves quickly enough to make up for its lack of originality. 

Lloyd Bacon's direction is good, and the big land rush sequence holds up even by today's standards.  He handles the other action sequences equally well.

All and all, this could have been quite a disaster given the odd casting, but in the end Cagney and Bogart do what big stars do, and carry the picture.
 
Bottom Line: The Oklahoma Kid is a descent western of extra interest to Cagney and Bogart fans for their rather unique roles.
