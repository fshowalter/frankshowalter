Synopsis: A writer’s (Frank Sinatra) return to his hometown causes complications for all those around him.

Some Came Running is a somewhat typical small town story lifted by top-notch performances and great production values.

Frank Sinatra carries the film well. His performance as a tortured writer is, for the most part, believable, and what he lacks in credibility he more than makes up for with sheer charisma.

Shirley MacLaine won an Oscar for her performance as a somewhat ditzy floozy who follows Sinatra’s character home, and while she borders on annoying early in the film, she shines in the second half.

But in the end, it’s Dean Martin who really steals the show.  His performance as gambler Bama Dillert is both believable and entertaining and ranks as one of his best.  His scenes with Sinatra are a joy to watch, as the chemistry between the two men is undeniable.

Director Vincente Minnelli gives the film a very polished look, and his excellent use of light and color make the film a visual treat.

If Some Came Running has a flaw it’s that its 137-minute length is feels wrong.  A longer running time could have fleshed out Shirley MacLaine's character a bit more, and a shorter one would have moved the story along better.  Either choice would have made for a better film.

Bottom Line: Great performances (especially Dean Martin) and great production elevate a solid script to something special.  Recommended.
