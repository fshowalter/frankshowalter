Russell channels John Wayne caught smack in the middle of a Shaw Brothers production mashed up with a Saturday morning serial and the result is almost impossible to dislike. From the over-the-top exposition to the tongue-in-cheek one-liners, though Carpenter treats his source material with reverence, he never takes _himself_ seriously. Sure, the Eddie and Margo characters are useless and there's no explaining all the neon in the secret underground chamber, but the movie’s so damn entertaining you just don’t care.
