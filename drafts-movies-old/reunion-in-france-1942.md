Synopsis: During World War II, a spoiled French heiress (Joan Crawford) hides a downed American pilot (John Wayne) from the Nazis in occupied Paris.

Reunion in France starts off slow.  The first half of the film can be a chore to get through, as there’s little in the way of likeable, or even believable, characters. Joan Crawford tries to carry the film, but her character simply isn’t strong enough.  She pritters and pratters until the Nazis arrive, then stomps around with the righteous indifference of a spoiled brat.

It’s not until the film’s almost halfway over that second billed John Wayne finally makes his entrance.  Fortunately, from then on the movie picks up considerably. 

Wayne’s easy charm gives the film a much-needed boost, and his character’s arrival finally jump-starts the plot.  Further, with Wayne to help share the load, Crawford can dial back her performance to relatable levels.  Granted Wayne’s arrival also coincides with the arrival of several decidedly <em>American</em> Germans, such as Howard Da Silva as a Gestapo agent, but that’s not a deal breaker. 

All this culminates in a very satisfying third act that almost makes you forget how slow the first half was.

Bottom Line: If you can make it through the first half, Reunion in France isn’t half-bad.
