Sensing desperation, and needing a new stuntman, director O'Toole offers fugitive Railsback a job. Railsback accepts and falls for leading lady Hershey, but soon wonders if O'Toole isn't trying to kill him. Rush's meta-movie features some great stunts and a knock-out performance from O'Toole, but the plot's repetitive nature is too clever for its two-hour-plus running time.
