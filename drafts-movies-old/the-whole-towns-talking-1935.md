Synopsis: A mild-mannered office clerk (Edward G. Robinson) discovers that he's a dead ringer for a notorious gangster (Edward G. Robinson).

The Whole Town's Talking is a rare example of a 30's comedy that doesn't rely on broad physical comedy, or inane characterization. Instead, director John Ford melds a gangster thriller with a refreshingly original case of mistaken identity for an enjoyable ride.

Lead Edward G. Robinson really gets to show off his acting chops playing the diametrically opposite roles of a mousy office worker and a hardened gangster. It's impressive the way his whole body language changes between roles, forcing you to accept that, despite their identical features, these are two separate men.

Further, director Ford doesn't make the mistake of overusing the gimmick of having Robinson onscreen with himself. It's there enough to establish the scenes where it's warranted, but that's it.

That said, the real strength of The Whole Town's Talking is the script. Rather than play the premise for cheap gags, the screenwriters work in a decent amount of drama, and avoid many of the scenarios you'd expect from the premise. Add to this, their scripting Jean Arthur's character as a refreshingly intelligent female lead, and you've got quite a rarity for its day and age. One that's certainly worth a look for Ford fans or of stars Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur.
