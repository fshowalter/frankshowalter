Synopsis: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues his quest to unlock the secrets of his past.

The Bourne Ultimatum picks up right where The Bourne Supremacy (2004) leaves off, and it’s pretty much one big chase from there to the film’s end.  Impressively, director Paul Greengrass is able to maintain a sizable amount of tension throughout most of the film’s 108 minutes.

The screenwriters should be commended.  In a genre where women are usually regulated to either eye candy or bitches, both Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are given strong, smart roles every bit the equal of their male co-stars.

The Bourne Ultimatum’s only real problem is the director’s overuse of the hand-held cam.  Does every shot need to be shaky?  Apparently, if you’re Paul Greengrass the answer is ‘Absolutely’.

Bottom Line: If you can get past the shaky camera work, and the hyper editing, it’s a hell of a ride.
