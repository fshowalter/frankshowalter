Synopsis: A psychiatrist gives four drug addicts from various walks of life LSD and documents their reactions to a Coffin Joe film.

Awakening of the Beast (Ritual dos Sádicos, O) is an ambitious film that ultimately collapses under the weight of its own aspirations.

While technically a Coffin Joe film, Awakening of the Beast marks a stark departure from the formula of its two prequels.  Instead of Joe’s usual quest for the perfect woman to bear him a son, Awakening of the Beast tries to deliver a social commentary on drugs and morality, with Joe as only a peripheral figure, an iconic, dream stalking, boogeyman.

Unfortunately, writer/director/star José Mojica Marins isn’t quite disciplined enough to pull off such a lofty goal.  While he does make some good points, Marins veers into exploitation with every other turn, and dilutes what could have been a much more powerful film.  There are hints of greatness here, to be sure, but they’re buried in a mess of camera tricks, gratuitous violence, and nudity. 

Bottom Line: Awakening of the Beast is a film unlike any you’ve probably seen and for some that will undoubtedly be enough of a recommendation, but fans of the earlier Coffin Joe pictures expecting a similar horror experience will likely be disappointed.
