Synopsis: A series of child killings terrorize a small Italian village.

Don’t Torture a Ducking (or Non si sevizia un paperino) is a well-made thriller.  While it contains its fair share of violence and gore, it’s not really a horror film, but rather a solid, beautifully shot, whodunit.

The script, by Gianfranco Clerici and director Lucio Fulci, while no doubt shocking for its time, is much less so now.  In fact, the script ages rather well.  Its only weakness is in its insistence on opting for shock over suspense, thus weakening what could have been a truly disturbing film.

Bottom Line: Definitely recommended for fans of the genre, others may be put off by the violence.
