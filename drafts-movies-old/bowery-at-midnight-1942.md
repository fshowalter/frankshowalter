Synopsis: A crook (Bela Lugosi) poses as a criminologist and uses his bowery soup kitchen as a front for his criminal gang.

Bowery at Midnight has a lot of plot for an hour-long movie.  Perhaps the filmmakers realized that none of the plot threads could stand on their own, so they threw them all in with the hope of overwhelming the viewer.

Sure, Lugosi is fun, but this movie feels like it was dreamed up, written, and shot all in the same day, especially the practically non-existent zombie sub plot that was clearly tacked-on in order to draw in Lugosi’s horror fans.

Bottom Line: Unless you’re a die-hard Lugosi fan, skip it.
