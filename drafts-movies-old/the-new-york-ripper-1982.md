Synopsis: A detective and a psychologist team up to track a killer preying on young women in New York City.

The New York Ripper (or Lo Squartatore di New York) works well during its first half, when you’d almost swear you were watching an Argento picture.  Then, inexplicably, the script shifts gears and degenerates into a sub-par police procedural.

Script problems aside, director Lucio Fulci turns in a well-photographed and well directed picture, although some will no doubt be put off by the violence which saw the film banned in several countries upon release, but isn’t really that shocking by today’s standards.

Bottom Line: Great for the first half, provided you’re not put-off by the violence.
