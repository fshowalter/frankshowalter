Synopsis: Chinese villagers hire a man (Jack Palance) to help them transport a trove of salvaged explosives a villain (Fernando Lamas) has his eye on.

Kill a Dragon is proof that bad action movies didn't originate in the 1980s. No, they were alive and well in 1976, as evidenced by this Jack Palance vehicle. 

The film opens with a group of Chinese villagers on the run from a group of thugs. As they flee through the docks of Hong Kong they stumble into Palance's boat, where he's about to bed a hooker. The shirtless Palance orders everyone off his boat, so he can resume his hooker bedding, and when the thugs won't leave, he proceeds to beat the crap out of them. 

Seriously, you can see how this movie can't be <em>all</em> bad.

Unfortunately, Kill a Dragon runs out of steam well before its finale. Everything moves along like gangbusters, with Palance showing up on the villager's island, kicking some ass, and catching the eye of an attractive local, until things stall when it becomes clear the budget can't cover a sea chase. Instead, the script meanders, keeping Palance on the villager's island with little to do aside from concoct overly elaborate schemes before the inevitable showdown with the head baddie.

In the end, this isn't a bad film so much as a disappointing one. Jack Palance is great, as is the Hong Kong location photography, but for a film built around action, Kill a Dragon ultimately lacks punch.
