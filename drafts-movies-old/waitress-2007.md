Synopsis: A small-town waitress (Keri Russell) struggles to find happiness while inventing new and interesting pies.

Waitress is a charming movie that manages to be endearing without being sappy. The script is smart and moves along quickly while still taking the time to provide some great character moments (most of which benefit a wonderfully cast Andy Griffith).

The weak-spot is an ending that feels a bit to contrived given the quaint originality of the rest of the movie.

Bottom Line: Give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
