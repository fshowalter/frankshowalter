Carpenter's amalgam of 50's sci-fi and social commentary casts Piper as an out-of-work drifter who discovers an alien conspiracy after putting on a special pair of sunglasses. The commentary ages well (Piper's line about several banks going under is a prime example) but the sci-fi is a different story. The special effects are shlock: they looked bad in 1988 and they still look bad now. 

That said, the film does have its redeeming qualities. While it's likely that Carpenter had frequent collaborator Kurt Russell in mind when he wrote the part, Piper is surprisingly solid as the lead, and reportedly ad-libbed the film's greatest line (one that almost single-handedly makes the whole thing worth watching), and when it clicks, the mix of blue-collar angst and pulp sci-fi makes for a rolling action-fantasy, but these moments are too few and far between as Carpenter can't seem to decide just how seriously he wants to take the material.
