Synopsis: A wheelchair-bound photographer (James Stewart) witnesses strange goings on while watching his neighbors.

Rear Window is a great example of a master director at the top of his game. Director Alfred Hitchcock takes a dynamite premise and exploits it to its full potential, delivering both a taunt thriller and a subtle expose of our voyeuristic society.

James Stewart and Grace Kelly seem to ooze charm and effortlessly pull you into the story, and Thelma Ritter, who plays Stewart's nurse, gets some of the script's best lines. The result is a movie that you can keep coming back to, time and again.

For his part Hitchcock tells the story flawlessly. While a lesser director would have spelled everything out, Hitch puts us in the room with Stewart and lets us come to our own conclusions as the story progresses.

Bottom Line: A classic. Highly recommended.
