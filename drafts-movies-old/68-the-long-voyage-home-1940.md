Despite getting top billing, Wayne's just an ensemble performer in this story of merchant seamen in the early days of World War II. Though the somber pacing can be a stumbling point (as can Wayne's Swedish accent), the film proves engrossing thanks to the colorful characterizations, strong performances (particularly Mitchell) and Toland's striking cinematography.
