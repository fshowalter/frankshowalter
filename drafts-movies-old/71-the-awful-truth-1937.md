Dunne and Grant play a couple trying to spoil each other's new romances before their divorce becomes final. While it's not laugh-out-loud funny, it's at least agreeable enough until the final third, when the script plunges precipitously into "screwball" comedy and features Dunne impersonating Grant’s non-existent sister in order to sabotage his burgeoning romance.  Not only is it unbelievable, but, more importantly, it’s not funny and only succeeds in draining any sympathy we might have had for Dunne. And it’s all downhill from there as Dunne nearly gets Grant arrested, trashes their car, and strands him at her country home. Then, despite all this, we’re expected to believe that he realizes how much he still loves her. Really?
