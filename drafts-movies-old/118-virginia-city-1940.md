After escaping from Scott's Confederate prison, Union soldier Flynn heads to Nevada to foil Scott's plan to transport a wealth of gold to the Confederate Army. Curtiz keeps things moving at a good clip, and Flynn and Scott are great, but Hopkins doesn't charm nearly enough and casting Bogart as a mustachioed Mexican bandit is just ridiculous. Fifth billed Frank McHugh is wasted in a little more than a cameo, as is Ward Bond, who isn't even credited. The latter is even more disappointing, as Bond would have been much better than Big Boy Williams as one of Flynn's sidekicks.
