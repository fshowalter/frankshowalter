Synopsis: An undercover federal marshal (John Wayne) solves a mystery involving a feared outlaw known only as “The Shadow”.

The Star Packer is a bit of a deviation from the standard John Wayne western of the time.  Along with the usual stunts and fisticuffs, writer/director Robert N. Bradbury mixes in some mystery elements that help keep things fresh.  Indeed the story could have just as easily worked in a big city as opposed to the old west, but either way the result is entertaining.

While the stunts and fight scenes belie the film’s shoestring budget, the casting of Yakima Canutt as Wayne’s Indian Sidekick seems almost comical (Wayne even calls him Yak).  Still, as far as Wayne’s early westerns go, this one stands out.

Bottom Line: Fans of Wayne or the genre should enjoy it, but others can pass.
