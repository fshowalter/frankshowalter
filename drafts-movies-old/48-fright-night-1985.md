Suburban teenager Charlie (Ragsdale) glances out his window during a late-night make-out session with his girlfriend (Bearse) and sees two men carrying a coffin into the basement of the vacant neighboring house. Intrigued, Charlie begins spying on the nightly goings on next-door, and soon discovers that his suave new neighbor Jerry (Sarandon) has fangs. After failing to convince his family, friends and even the local police of the danger in their midst, Charlie turns to the local creature feature host, Peter Vincent (McDowall).

After opening as a teen comedy, with Ragsdale equally frustrated  by the lack of action with Bearse and a recently sprung pop-quiz, the film steadily ratchets up the horror and suspense, often segueing between the two via some choice dialog from Sarandon, who mixes equal parts charm and menace in a memorable performance. For his part, McDowall has a lot of fun channelling Peter Cushing, hamming it up in the movie-within-a-movie early on, and dialing it back just enough in the second half to make things work. The resulting film is not only a tremendous amount of fun for horror fans, but one that takes its place as a classic alongside the very films it pays tribute to.
