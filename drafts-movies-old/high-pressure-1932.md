Synopsis: A con man (William Powell) masterminds a stock swindle involving synthetic rubber.

High Pressure works because of William Powell. The movie is as much a testament to his charisma and presence as any in his career, as he carries the entire show from start to finish with his relentlessly engaging performance as a fast-talking con man capable of manipulating anyone, including the audience. While Powell was still years away from his breakout success in The Thin Man, it’s clear he was well on his way to establishing himself one of the premier leading men of the post-silent era.

The script by Joseph Jackson from Aben Kandel’s play is a rapid-fire delight. Granted, it’s no <a href="/browse/reviews/his-girl-friday-1940/">His Girl Friday (1940)</a>, but the fast dialog and relentless pacing do make for an enjoyable ride and allow Powell to gloss over the film’s shortcomings.

Aiding Powell is a solid supporting cast, with George Sidney and Frank McHugh as the standouts playing members of Powell’s character’s entourage. Evelyn Brent is somewhat flat as Powell’s character’s love interest, but at least she doesn’t overplay the part—a rarity amongst female performers of the day.

While High Pressure may not be a "must see," fans of Powell’s later films such as <a href="/browse/reviews/my-man-godfrey-1936/">My Man Godfrey (1936)</a> or <a href="/browse/reviews/the-great-ziegfeld-1936/">The Great Ziegfeld (1963)</a> will certainly want to give it a look.
