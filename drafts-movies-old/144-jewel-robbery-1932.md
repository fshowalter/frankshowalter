Baroness Francis falls for a debonair jewel thief Powell who, after robbing her and her aristocratic companions, gives them marijuana cigarettes to stone them into supplication. By the time the cops arrive, everyone is giggle happy and Powell and company are long gone. Ah, you've gotta love pre-code Hollywood. 

The rest of the film is a lighthearted romance between Powell and Francis, who was apparently regarded as quite stunning at the time, but comes across as a bit odd now. Not homely, but certainly not the stunning beauty the script would lead you to believe. For his part, Powell is perfect. All smooth charm and subtle innuendo, he makes the film by charming not only Francis, but us as well. It's a performance that Cary Grant would later echo in Alfred Hitchcock's _To Catch a Thief (1955)_, but Powell does it better here.
