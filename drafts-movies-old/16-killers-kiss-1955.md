With practically no budget, Kubrick had to rely on guerrilla filmmaking techniques, such as using pickup trucks for dollies and shooting without permits, but the result is a visually arresting film that does a fantastic job capturing the atmosphere of 1950’s New York.  Technical problems forced Kubrick to record all the dialog and sound effects in post-production, yet the sound editing is superb during the fight scenes, which have a surprisingly genuine ferocity to them.  Unfortunately, Kubrick’s technical achievements are undone by a flimsy story (Smith, a boxer falls for Kane, his neighbor, after she's attacked by her boss, Silvera, a gangster who soon has it in for Smith) and a weak cast. Not a total loss, but a better cast and proper dialog recording would have gone a long way.
