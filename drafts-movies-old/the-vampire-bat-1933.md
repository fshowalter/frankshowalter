Synopsis: After villagers start turning up dead and drained of blood, local townspeople suspect a vampire.

The Vampire Bat is a highly atmospheric thriller that works almost in spite of itself.

For the first three-quarters, The Vampire Bat is a solid a mystery-thriller.  The very American Melvyn Douglas plays a German policeman who, along with a doctor played by Lionel Atwill, investigates a series of mysterious deaths in the local village.  All signs point to a vampire and the local loon played by Dwight Frye (in a performance very reminiscent of his turn in <a href="/browse/reviews/dracula-1931/">Dracula (1931)</a>) is the chief suspect. 

The film slowly builds in suspense and mystery until, surprisingly, the final quarter veers into sci-fi territory.  Granted, the special effects are laughably bad, but the diversion gives the story a welcome and unique twist that makes this hour-long diversion a bit more memorable.

Bottom Line: While itâ€™s by no means a classic, The Vampire Bat should please fans of the early Universal Monster films.
