When his favorite cheesecake baker is murdered, Runyonesque gambler Gloves Donahue and his gang spring into action in this surprisingly sure-handed mix of comedy, action, and mystery buoyed by a first-rate cast. Bogart's portrayal of Gloves, a "man about town and well-known figure in the sporting world," may lack the gravitas of his more famous roles, but it still ranks as one of his most fun. Sherman keeps things moving along at a good clip and even orchestrates the first edition of a famous action sequence, wherein a character is caught on the upper floors of a building and uses a fire-hose as a makeshift bungee cord to dive off, narrowly avoiding disaster.  And you thought that was pretty clever in _Die Hard_ didn't you?
