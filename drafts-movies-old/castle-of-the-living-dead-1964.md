Synopsis: A nobleman (Christopher Lee) invites a group of entertainers to his castle, intent on using them as unwitting specimens in his research.

Castle of the Living Dead (Il Castello dei morti vivi) is an atmospheric, but ultimately lacking Italian horror, notable chiefly for the involvement of Christopher Lee, Donald Sutherland, and Michael Reeves.

Lee makes the movie as the enigmatic Count Drago.  With his dark eye makeup, and booming voice, the film picks up considerably when he finally makes his appearance.

Donald Sutherland, in just his second film appearance, does a bang-up job in a three-part role, appearing as a bumbling police sergeant, an old witch, and an old man.  He genuinely seems to be having fun with all the parts and manages to find the perfect tone with each.

The involvement of Michael Reeves is interesting.  Credited as a writer, and uncredited as a director, Reeves’ hand seems strongest in the interactions between the entertainers.  There are echoes there, albeit faint, of his later, superior, works.

Unfortunately, despite the talent involved, Castle of the Living Dead moves along at a dreadfully slow pace, with little to no tension along the way.  Granted, there’s atmosphere to spare, but the filmmaker’s failure to give the story’s basic premise any kind of edge results in a horror film with no horror.

Bottom Line: While fans of Christopher Lee will find something of value in his performance, others would do well to look elsewhere, such as the superior <a href="/browse/reviews/the-city-of-the-dead-1960/">The City of the Dead (1960)</a>.
