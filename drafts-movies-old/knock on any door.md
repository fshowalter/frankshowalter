<cite>Knock on Any Door</cite> is the story of Nick Romano, played by John Derek, a young hood who opens the film arrested for emptying a pistol into a policeman. Nick calls Andrew Morton, a self-made attorney who worked his way out of the slums, played by Humphrey Bogart. Andrew says he wants nothing to do with the case, but gets involved anyway. 

Andrew checks out Nick's alibi, which seems solid. As he mulls over taking the case, his bosses imply that taking the case would nix his chance at a promotion to partner. As Andrew says, "So, it's like that, eh?" Andrew takes the case. 

Framed by Andrew's opening statement, we see Nick's life story through a series of flashbacks, starting with Nick bursting into Andrew's office as a young boy, demanding to know what Andrew is going to do to help Nick's family. It seems Nick's father was arrested for murder and the family took what should have been an open-and-shut case of self-defense to Andrew, but Andrew was busy with an estate case, and passed the Romano case to another attorney who maybe didn't give a hundred and ten percent and, as a result, Nick's father went to jail. Andrew accompanies Nick home to talk with Nick's mother and just as Andrew tells her he's going to do all he can to help her husband, word arrives that papa Romano has died of a heart attack in prison.

Flash-forward and the family has moved to the slums. Neighborhood hooligans jump young Nick, who's on his way home with the family groceries. They scuffle, but Nick fights them off. The groceries are lost.

Flash-forward some more. Nick's in his late teens and running with the very crowd that jumped him earlier. They're robbing stores and fencing jewelry, anything for a fast buck and cheap thrill. Nick and his buddy steal a car and get caught by the cops.

Flash-forward: Nick's in reform school, where he and his buddy are sopping up the floor with towels as a form of punishment. Nick's buddy is coughing like he's punctured a lung, but the guards are oblivious. Nick's buddy collapses, and Nick charges the guards, who turn the hose on him. Nick's buddy dies.

Flash-forward: Andrew visits Nick in reform school. Nick cops an attitude, saying Andrew wouldn't know what it was like in that place. Andrew says he's been in worse places, and offers to help Nick out. Nick blows him off.

Flash-forward: Nick's out of reform school and established as a small-time hustler. When he's short on cash, he makes a play to knock off a candy store, but finds himself taken by the counter girl, Emma. The two date but in a rare selfless act, Nick leaves her, warning her that he's no good.

Flash-forward: Nick's caught stealing and risks jail time but Andrew intervenes, taking Nick fishing in an attempt at rehabilitation. Things go well until Nick overhears a conversation between Andrew and a friend discussing Nick's progress. Nick throws a hissy, does a lot of emoting, and steals a hundred bucks from Andrew's jacket before skipping town.

Flash-forward: Nick's back with Emma, but Andrew tracks him down and, in perhaps the film's most satisfying moment, rolls him in an alley. 

Flash-forward. Nick visits Andrew, apologizes and tells Andrew about his upcoming marriage to Emma. Andrew wishes him well and offers to help out any way he can.

Flash-forward. Nick's married and trying to make a go of it, but  thanks to his temper and reluctance to work his way up, can't hold a job. Nick reaches his breaking point and, after a few drinks, comes home to announce that he's leaving. As Nick puts his hood suit back on and combs his hair, Emma pleads with him to reconsider. Nick won't listen. Emma confesses that she's pregnant. Nick tells her that what he said still goes: "Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse." Nick walks out and Emma commits suicide by turing on the gas oven.

Unaware, Nick meets up with his gang and they rob a train station. The job goes wrong and Nick finds himself on the run from the cops. When he's picked up, he calls Andrew and now we're back where we started. 

The trials progresses and Andrew discredits the prosecution's evidence, but when Nick gets on the stand the prosecutor brings up Emma and Nick loses his temper and confesses. 

Andrew then delivers a stirring monologue on how society is really to blame as society made Nick and will continue making kids just like Nick until it gets serious about cleaning up the slums.

The film ends with Nick walking to the electric chair.

With Bogart's big speech about society's ills as the film's dramatic centerpiece, <cite>Knock on Any Door</cite> is a social commentary first, and a courtroom drama second. Director Nicholas Ray doesn't hint and suggest, from the opening zooming closeup of a policeman blowing a whistle, to Bogart's closing oratory directly to the camera, this is an in-your-face film, and that's a large part of what sinks it.

Putting aside all the contrived melodrama--Nick's father dying just as Andrew says he'll help, Nick's heretofore healthy friend dropping dead before age twenty, Emma committing suicide--what really kills the film is how disingenuous it all feels. Thanks to the censors, none of the characters could curse, nobody could get away with murder, and topics like abortion were off-limits. So, while film keeps throwing the cruel circumstances of Nick's life in our faces, in the film's white-washed, orchestrated world, Nick comes off as a selfish brat, not a hard-luck sob-story, and it's hard to care about a brat.
