Super spy and renaissance Ã¼ber man, Derek Flint saves the world from a cabal of women seeking to take over the world by replacing the president and brainwashing women with hairdryers. An even more ridiculous retread of the earlier _Our Man Flint (1966)_ that works thanks to Coburn's deadpan performance as Flint, which is still a lot of fun, though the decision to dress straight-man Cobb in drag nearly sinks the film.
