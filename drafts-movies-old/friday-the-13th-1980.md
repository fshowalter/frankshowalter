Synopsis: Teen counselors attempt to re-open a summer camp, closed twenty years prior after a pair of gruesome murders.

Friday the 13th isn’t as bad, or as good, as some would say.  It borrows heavily from Reazione a catena (1971) other Italian giallo films, and while director Sean S. Cunningham lacks the flair of an Argento or Bava, he does a solid job.

The commercial success of the film can’t be ignored.  Grossing almost $40 million and spawning countless sequels, Friday the 13th became part of the 80’s zeitgeist. This was due in no small part to a great ending that can still make audiences jump thirty years later.

Additionally, Friday the 13th manages to combine several elements of its successful predecessors.  If Psycho in 1960 was the birth of the slasher film, then The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in 1974 was the next milestone, replacing beautiful Janet Leigh and Vera Miles with a group of decidedly non-starlet kids, thus bringing the terror closer to home.  Four years later Halloween would up the ante by setting the massacre not in an out-of-the-way motel, or back-woods road, but right in suburbia.  By choosing a summer camp, Friday the 13th places a group of non-starlets in a location that combines both the isolation of the deserted motel and the back-woods country with the familiarity of suburbia. This dovetails nicely with director Cunningham’s use of POV shots, a technique used heavily in Halloween, and also by Argento and Bava.

Bottom Line: A solid little would-be-giallo with a great ending.
