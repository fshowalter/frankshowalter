Kubrick's non-linear deconstruction of a meticulously planned racetrack heist is marred by only some awful (supposedly studio-mandated) voice-over narration, and a slightly too strong performance by Marie Windsor. Despite its shortcomings, the film marks an important step in the evolution of the film noir genre, one that bridges the gap between John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s Reservoir Dogs (1992).
