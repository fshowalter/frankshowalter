Synopsis: A witch (Kim Novak) casts a love spell on her publisher neighbor (James Stewart).

Bell Book and Candle has all the ingredients to make a great movie.  There’s star power (James Stewart, Jack Lemon, and Kim Novak), a great premise, and good production, but unfortunately the result isn’t as good as the sum of the parts.

The script, based on a play, simply isn’t very funny.  Another director may have gotten more out of it (Billy Wilder would have been perfect), but we’ll never know.  Director Richard Quine does a competent, but unremarkable job.

If not for the sheer charisma of principal cast, Bell Book and Candle would be a chore to sit through but, like true stars, Stewart, Novak, and Lemon carry the picture.

Bottom Line: Charming, but forgettable.
