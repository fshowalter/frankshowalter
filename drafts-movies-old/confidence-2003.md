Synopsis: A con man (Edward Burns) recruits a mysterious woman (Rachel Weisz) to help him swindle a money launderer (Robert Forster) in order to pay back a mobster (Dustin Hoffman).

Given its stellar cast, Confidence should be better. Paul Giamatti, Donal Logue, Luis Guzm√°n, Tommy Lister, Robert Forster, Andy Garcia, Morris Chestnut: the cast reads like a who's-who of indie character actors, yet the best director James Foley and screenwriter Doug Jung can offer is a retread of the same material David Mamet covered 15 years earlier in <a href="/browse/reviews/house-of-games-1987">House of Games (1987)</a> with a bit of The Usual Suspects (1994) thrown in.

It's not that Jung's script is bad, just that anyone who's seem Mamet's films will be one-step ahead the whole time, anticipating the twists rather than being surprised by them. Further, aside from some sleaze in the form of Dustin Hoffman's ADD-afflicted mobster, Jung doesn't bring much originality to the formula. That, combined with the flashback device used to frame the story, shackle the film with a handicap it never overcomes.

Perhaps those unfamiliar with Mamet's work will find Confidence a bit more entertaining, and that's fine. But if you're one of those folks, make it a priority to watch House of Games and <a href="/browse/reviews/the-spanish-prisoner-1997/">The Spanish Prisoner (1997)</a>. You're in for a treat.
