Synopsis: A priest (Humphrey Bogart) confronts a warlord (Lee J. Cobb) at a mission in 1947 China.

The Left Hand of God features several things you don’t often see, including Bogart in color (he only made a handful of color films), Bogart on horseback (he looks surprisingly comfortable), and Lee J. Cobb made up as a Chinese warlord.  It’s that last one that really hurts the movie.

The film’s first half works well.  Bogart seems tailor made for the part of a troubled priest caught in war-torn China. Gene Tierney is passable as the female lead, and the great production values give story a heightened sense of gravitas. 

Then, just when the film seems poised to make a real statement about faith and identity, it trots out Lee J. Cobb made up as a Chinese warlord, and in doing so, destroys its credibility.  Though he’s nowhere near as over the top, Cobb still brings to mind Boris Karloff in <a href="/browse/reviews/west-of-shanghai-1937/">West of Shanghai (1937)</a>. 

Despite this near-fatal stumble, The Left Hand of God remains entertaining, largely due its brief 87 minute running time, great cinematography, and the sizable charisma of Humphrey Bogart.

Bottom Line: Despite the laughable casting of Lee J. Cobb as a Chinese warlord, Bogart fans should still enjoy this.
