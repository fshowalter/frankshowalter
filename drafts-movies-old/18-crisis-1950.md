Grant plays a brain surgeon vacationing with his wife in an unnamed South American country where he's abducted and forced to operate on a dictator, played by Ferrer. Provided you can get past Grant as a brain surgeon, it's an entertaining drama, boosted by a surprisingly even-handed script, a strong supporting cast, and a solid turn from Ferrer.
