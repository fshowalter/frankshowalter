Kelly's choreographed fight scenes account for the fifteen minutes of good in this 125 minute adaptation of Dumas' novel. Sidney can't seem to decide just how seriously he wants to take the material, resulting in an uneven mess that veers from slapstick to dark melodrama, never finding its footing. To make matters even worse, the script is talky, grinding to a halt between duels, leaving you plenty of time to realize the absurdity of Kelly playing a Frenchman.
