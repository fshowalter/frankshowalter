Fontaine begins to suspect new husband Grant might be a murderer, and that she might be his next victim. Great performances from Fontaine and Grant, a memorable supporting turn from Nigel Bruce and some classic Hitchcock visuals including the famous "milk shot" offset the cop-out ending. It's not bad, but it could have been great.
