Sexually frustrated Charlie can't get to second base with Amy, his girlfriend of almost a year, while his vampire neighbor Jerry is a veritable stud, able to command the sexual attention of any women (including Amy, and even Charlie's mom) with little more than a look. There's also a homosexual subtext hinted at with Jerry's male roommate, and again with Jerry's seduction of Charlie's teen friend Ed, played by Stephen Geoffreys, with Jerry almost cooing that he, "knows what it's like being different". And is it too much of a stretch to consider the effete Peter Vincent's lack of faith as a metaphor for facing his own buried homosexuality? Perhaps. But filmmakers have long used the horror genre to explore issues of sexual identity, and just as Dracula mined Victorian sexual repression, Fright Night plumbs 1980's teenage sexual angst, though in a far more subtle manner manner than many of its contemporaries, most of which consisted of little more than, as McDowall says "Demented madmen running around in ski-masks hacking up young virgins."
