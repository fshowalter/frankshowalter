Synopsis: After joining San Quentin’s prison guard, an ex-Army officer (Pat O’Brien) falls for the sister (Ann Sheridan) of one of the inmates (Humphrey Bogart).

San Quentin is a fairly routine melodrama, elevated by a quality cast.

O’Brien, Bogart, and Sheridan all radiate charisma, with O’Brien in particular feeling custom tailored to the part of the stern, but well-meaning prison guard.  Even the supporting cast is above par, with Barton MacLane and Joe Sawyer giving fine turns as a corrupt guard and hardened criminal, respectively.

Director Lloyd Bacon keeps the running time down to a lean 70 minutes, moving through a lot of plot in an efficient manor while still allowing his stars to shine.  This is a popcorn movie, to be sure, but one that doesn’t wear out its welcome.

Bottom Line: A pleasant enough effort that fans of Bogart or O’Brien should enjoy.
