Bogart plays a once-big circus promoter reduced to playing small rural towns. He thinks he's caught a break when he discovers a naive store clerk with a knack for lion taming played by Albert. Bogart makes Albert a star, and the circus plays to bigger and bigger crowds, but along the way Albert falls for Bogart's sister, which--unknown to Albert--leads Bogart to try and sabotage Albert's act. It's a by-the-numbers remake of Kid Galahad (1937) that works thanks to the strong cast and streamlined script that clocks in almost twenty minutes shorter--in part because they gave Bogart's Galahad role to a lion.
