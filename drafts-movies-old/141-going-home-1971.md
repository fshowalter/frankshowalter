As a child, Vincent sees his father, played by Mitchum, kill his mother. Years later Vincent, now a grown man, learns Mitchum is out on parole and seeks to reconnect, but has trouble reconciling the monster of his youth with the man of today. Mitchum's solid as usual, and Leonard has quite a knack for nailing atmosphere, but it's not clear what the filmmakers are trying to say, and their mistaking shock for dramatic punch leaves the film hollow.
