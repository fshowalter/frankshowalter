Synopsis: A man (John Wayne) searching for his father’s killer impersonates an outlaw.

West of the Divide is an unremarkable Lone Star production. 

The cast is a mixed bag.  While John Wayne and Gabby Hayes are fine, Virginia Brown Faire is horrible as Wayne’s love interest, as she and Wayne have zero chemistry.  At least Lloyd Whitlock is suitably smarmy as the head baddie.
 
The real problem here is the script, which has all the characteristics of a rush job.  Writer/director Robert Bradbury strings together some great stunts with awkward expositionary dialog, a trend sent from the very first scene, in which Wayne is inexplicably recounting the tragic events surrounding his father’s death to his long time buddy who’s clearly heard the story several times before.

Fortunately, West of the Divide does include some of Yakima Cannutt’s trademark stunts, including a great runaway carriage scene and a dynamite leap by Wayne from a galloping horse through a window. 

Bottom Line: Fans of the Lone Star westerns won’t be disappointed, but others should look elsewhere.
