Synopsis: In 1960’s London, a young working-class man (Michael Caine) carelessly uses women without regard for their feelings.

Alfie works, primarily, because of Michael Caine.  His performance in the titular role makes the film, and it’s an ingenious trick.  Watching the film, you’re appalled at the way Alfie treats everyone around him, yet you still care about him because Caine charms the film’s <em>audience</em> the very same way Alfie charms the film’s <em>characters</em>. 

The film also works because of the talent behind the camera.  Screenwriter Bill Naughton does a wonderful job adapting his play, and director Lewis Gilbert does a spectacular job capturing 60’s London atmosphere.  Further, Gilbert avoids the “stagy” feel that dogs many theater adaptations. 

Alfie is a movie that gets you thinking without ever being preachy.  As a character Alfie is a representation of a societal problem, one that we’ve yet to find a solution for today, and it’s that relevance, combined with Caine’s performance, that makes Alfie stand up well to repeat viewings.

If Alfie has a weakness, it’s Shelley Winters, who’s miscast in a very critical role.  She does her best, but there’s no chemistry between her and Caine, causing the film’s finale to suffer. 

Bottom Line: An entertaining, yet ultimately thought-provoking drama highlighted by a career-making performance from Michael Caine.  Recommended.
