Corman's third Poe adaptation is the best of the series. Price, surrounded by a great supporting cast, drops the camp and plays a straight villain whose every line drips condescension, in the process delivering one of the finest performances of his career.

Visually, the costumes and sets pack a Technicolor pop that culminates in a Grand Guignol finale that ranks amongst Corman's finest cinematic moments.
