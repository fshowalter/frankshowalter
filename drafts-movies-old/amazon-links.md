As some of my eight loyal readers may have noticed, my reviews now feature links to DVDs for sale at Amazon.

Any purchase made through these links gives me a small commission.  Eventually, I hope to cover my monthly hosting costs, but for now I’ll settle for a free pint at the pub.

As for the links themselves, I make every effort to link to the best quality DVD available.  This means original color and aspect ratio with the best print-quality possible.  However, Amazon isn’t consistent with its DVD descriptions, so if anyone notices a sub-standard DVD link, please let me know via the comments and I’ll take the appropriate action.
