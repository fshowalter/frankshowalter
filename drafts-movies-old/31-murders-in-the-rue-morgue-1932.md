Lugosi plays a mad scientist who, after hours, injects blood from his sideshow ape Erik into abducted women in some don't-think-too-hard-about-them experiments designed to prove the human-ape evolutionary link. Good set design and stylish cinematography can't overcome a talky script and ape suit effects that aren't fooling anyone. John Huston is credited as a writer but good luck recognizing any of his work. The scariest thing about this movie is Lugosi's unibrow.
