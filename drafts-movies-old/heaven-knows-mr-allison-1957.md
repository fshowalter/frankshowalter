Synopsis: A marine (Robert Mitchum) finds himself stranded on an island in the south Pacific along with a nun (Deborah Kerr).

Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison is an enjoyable film built around a solid script and great performances from the leads.

The script by director John Huston and John Lee Mahin is littered with great dialog and does a great job maintaining the tension, both sexual and otherwise, while never becoming too serious.

The performances are great.  Mitchum gives one of the best performances of his career in a role that seems written for him, while Kerr also is completely charming in a role that could have easily come across as annoying.

Bottom Line: A good little movie.  Recommended.
