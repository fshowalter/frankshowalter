William Holden plays the titular character in <cite>Boots Malone</cite>, a once-premier jockey's agent who's gone from living in the Ritz to living in the stables. Malone's deep in hock with his bookie, and thinking of leaving town when a 15-year-old runaway named Tommy comes into a diner and tries to pay for his meal with a c-note. With eyes full of dollar signs, Malone takes the kid under his wing, intent on riding the gravy train. 

We know where this story is going. Young Tommy will break through Malone's cynical shell and the two will forge a father-son relationship. This film is more literal than most in that when young Tommy registers for his first race he does so under the name of Tommy Malone, but that's okay. <cite>Boots Malone</cite> may not be a good film, but it is an interesting one. From claim races to saddle sizes, we learn a lot about horse racing. Shot on real race tracks, the sets are hot, dusty, and you can almost <em>smell</em> the horses. If only the melodrama were as realistic. 

The problem is that Johnny Stewart's portrayal of Tommy Gibson is only serviceable until he's called upon to show any kind of emotion, at which point his dials go from one to ten with nothing in between. We're expected to care about his character, yet within such a nuanced and believable world, his emoting reduces his character to a plot device, and <cite>Boots Malone</cite> to an also-ran.

William Holden plays the titular character in <cite>Boots Malone</cite>, a once-premier jockey's agent who's been reduced to living in horse trainer Preacher Cole's tack room. 

Malone's deep in hock with a bookie, Mason, and thinking of leaving town when a young runaway named Tommy Gibson comes into a diner and tries to pay for his meal with a c-note. Boots spies an opportunity and--with eyes full of dollar signs--takes the kid under his wing.

By the next morning, Tommy's taken with track life and--with a bit of prompting--hires Boots to train him to be a jockey. Boots has the kid clean the stables and haul hay in the guise of building his strength.

Disaster strikes when Preacher's only horse is bought out from under him in a claims race. A despondent Preacher nearly murders the new owner, but Boots talks him down. Realizing the track is all Preacher has, the rest of the track-regulars chip-in to buy a replacement and Boots cooks up a scheme to get a solid horse on the cheap. 

Their plan's a success and Boots heads south with Preacher and Tommy to train the new horse in secret. By now they realize they need a jockey and Tommy, in a freak accident involving a snake, proves he can ride. Boots stops giving the kid chores and starts teaching him how to be a jockey.

The plan is to sneak Preacher's new horse into a race where he'll be a big underdog so the track regulars--knowing his true potential--can bet their savings on the would-be long shot and cash big. 

After months of training, Boots sets up their first race. Tommy registers for his jockey's license as Tommy Malone. Boots and Preacher weight their horse down with heavy shoes so he'll perform poorly and be a surefire underdog for his next race, but they don't tell Tommy, who spends several minutes crying into a pillow after losing the race, believing it his fault, so Boots arranges for Tommy to ride another horse in a subsequent race, and Tommy wins, full of smiles.

Now everything's set, and the group heads back north for the real race. Boots even tips his bookie Mason to bet the farm on their horse in the hopes of squaring things. 

But then, in a fit of plot, Tommy turns out to be a rich runaway from boarding school and his antiseptic, highbrow mother has a reward out for his return. When a detective starts asking questions around the track, Boots realizes it's just a matter of time and turns Tommy in, hoping to claim the reward. Of course, Tommy's mother has no intention of paying and Boots leaves empty handed and heart-broken.

With no jockey for the big race in the morning, things look hopeless, but Tommy, not wanting to let the group down, skips out of his train back to boarding school and rejoins the crew at the track. He tries to play it tough in front of everyone but breaks down in a fit of emoting once he and Boots are alone. "I came back for you, Boots!" he says. Oh, the drama.

But wait, there's more. Mason has indeed bet the farm, but on the favorite, not Boots' horse. Now Mason wants Boots to throw the race, "Just to be sure." Boots can't bring himself to tell Tommy and, of course, Tommy wins. 

The film ends with Boots seeing Tommy onto his train back to boarding school, all the while looking over his shoulder for Mason's hoods who are sure to plug Boots for the money Mason lost. Boots sounds ready to face the music, but instead, hops the train with Tommy, and they live happily ever after. Or something.
