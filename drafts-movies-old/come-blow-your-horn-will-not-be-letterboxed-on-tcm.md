Despite featuring a prime, Rat Pack era, Frank Sinatra, Come Blow Your Horn, the 1963 film adaptation of Neil Simon’s play is, by most accounts, not very good.  But I wouldn’t know.

The print being shown by <a href="http://www.tcm.com">Turner Classic Movies</a> isn’t letterboxed, despite the film’s 2.35 : 1 aspect ratio, which means that roughly a third of the picture is missing, resulting in a cramped mess.  I turned it off after five minutes.

I contacted TCM about the problem, and they regretfully informed me that the print they’re showing is the only one available from the film’s distributor.  Compounding this is the fact that film isn’t available on DVD, letterboxed or otherwise.

So what’s left?  Hope that the <a href="http://www.afi.com/silver/">AFI Silver</a> gets a real print I can see on the big screen.  Until then, Come Blow Your Horn will remain a mystery.
