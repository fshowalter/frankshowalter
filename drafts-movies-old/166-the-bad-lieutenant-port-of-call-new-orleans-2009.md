Cage plays a drug and gambling addicted cop in post-Katrina New Orleans investigating the execution style slaying of an immigrant family. Herzog does a great job grounding the film in the dirty, flood-ravaged streets of New Orleans, and Cage shows flashes of his younger brilliance as the lead, but while Herzog insists he never saw Abel Ferrara's _Bad Lieutenant (1992)_, the screenwriters certainly did, as the script is nothing but a pastiche of the corrupt cop genre, bringing nothing new to the table.
