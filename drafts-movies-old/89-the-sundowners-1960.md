In 1920’s Australia, Mitchum and Kerr play married sheep herders, roaming from town to town with their son, played by Michael Anderson Jr. Mitchum’s content with this life, proud of having nothing to tie him down and no long-term worries. Along the way, they meet another vagabond, played by the immensely charming Ustinov, who sees a kindred soul in Mitchum and joins up with the family. The conflict comes when Kerr and Anderson Jr. want to settle down and buy a farm.

Despite being a period picture about a family of sheep herders with Mitchum doing an Australian accent, the film is extremely compelling, highlighted by Hildyard’s framing of the sprawling hills and vast, open country, and an organic plot that packs a dramatic punch. And Mitchum's accent is just fine.
