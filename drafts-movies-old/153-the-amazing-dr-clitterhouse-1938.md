Robinson is the titular doctor, a society physician secretly investigating criminal behavior by committing jewel heists then collecting data about his physical state of being. Beneath the Warner gangster facade, screenwriters Wexley and Huston craft a nice black comedy with Robinson as a mad scientist. The crackling dialog (likely the work of Huston) and fast-paced direction make it an enjoyable ride. Unfortunate title, though.
