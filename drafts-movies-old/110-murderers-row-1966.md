Dino's back as Matt Helm, this time thwarting a BIG-O plot involving a Helio-Beam. He's got a nicer car, a better co-star in Ann-Margret, and a bigger budget as evidenced by the Monaco location shooting, but this second entry in the Matt Helm series lacks much of the quirky charm that made the first, The Silencers (1966), something of a guilty pleasure.
