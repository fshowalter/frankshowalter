Synopsis: A union spy (Errol Flynn), a confederate spy (Randolph Scott), a saloon singer (Miriam Hopkins), and a Mexican bandit (Humphrey Bogart!) all vie for a wagon full of gold.

Virginia City is a solid Errol Flynn vehicle marred by two casting flubs.  The first is Miriam Hopkins in a role that should have gone to Olivia de Havilland. The second, and more severe, is the absurd casting of a mustachioed Humphrey Bogart as a Mexican bandit. 
	
Despite those casting errors, Virginia City still works due to the innate charisma of Flynn and Scott, and the great chemistry between them.  Their differing interpretations of suave ruggedness provide a great contrast that crackles whenever they share the screen. 

Director Michael Curtiz, ever the technician, keeps things moving quickly and handles the film’s big action sequences with ease.  He also seems to recognize the casting weaknesses, and downplays both Hopkins and Bogart, much to the film’s benefit (although a little more downplaying of Hopkins wouldn’t have hurt).

Bottom Line: An okay Errol Flynn western that could have been pretty good with a couple of casting changes.
