In an unnamed tropical island dictatorship, American actress Ford is mistaken for one of revolutionist Grier's gang and sentenced to hard labor at a women's jungle prison. Gratuitous nudity, violence and wrestling ensues. Exploitation cinema at its basest, there's overt sexism, homophobia, and racism to spare, but Hill's unabashedly professional approach to the material makes for a surprisingly well-done film, with great Filipino location photography and charismatic turns from Grier and Sid Haig.
