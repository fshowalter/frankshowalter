Lucile Ball is best known as a comedienne and star of the screwball sitcom _I Love Lucy_. I was never a fan of the show, but after seeing _Lured_, I wish she'd done more "straight" roles.

The story is set in London. The mysterious "Poet Killer" taunts the police with rhyming hints, while luring his victims with ads in the personal columns. 

Ball plays Sandra Carpenter, a taxi dancer who worries that her missing friend may be the killer's latest victim.

Sandra goes to Scotland Yard. Impressed by her legs and observational skills, Inspector Temple, played by Charles Coburn, asks her to work undercover in the hopes of capturing the killer. Sandra accepts and sets about answering various personal ads. She's shadowed by her Scotland Yard bodyguard, Officer Barrett, played by George Zucco.

Along the way she encounters a deranged dress designer played by Boris Karloff, breaks up a white slavery ring and falls for a womanizing nightclub owner played by George Sanders. Sandars, of course, turns out to be the chief "Poet Killer" suspect.

Don't let the opening shots fool you, Lured isn't a police procedural, noir, or horror film, but a mystery adventure, with Ball as a street-smart, plucky heroine far removed from her I Love Lucy persona.

For the first three-quarters of it's running time, the film coasts along. The script keeps us guessing by throwing out one red herring after another. Sanders is fun as an unabashed cad. 

But once the killer is revealed, the only mystery left is how the script will orchestrate its inevitable conclusion, making the final quarter something of a bore.
