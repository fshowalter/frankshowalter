Hitchcock's utterly engrossing thriller puts us a sweltering apartment with Stewart, a daredevil photojournalist stuck in a wheelchair nursing a broken leg. We share in his guilty pleasure as he watches his neighbors through a telephoto lens, but what starts as a pastime quickly turns to obsession as we begin to suspect one of the neighbors of murder. Soon, we're _trapped_ in the apartment with Stewart, as his beautiful girlfriend, played by Kelly, finds herself in mortal danger in the neighbor's apartment and all we can do is watch, because Stewart, like us, is just an audience, at least until the murder looks out his window, and out of the movie, and sees us.
