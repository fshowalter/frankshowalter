Sheriff Hayes joins up with mystery man Wayne to help homesteaders beset by outlaws. After a surprisingly atmospheric opening set during a roaring thunderstorm, Bradbury's script settles into the usual Monogram beats of mistaken identity, chases and fistfights, and even though it's a bit short on logic (I love how the bad guys never yell for help when Wayne lassos them), Canutt's stunts make it entertaining. For their part, Wayne and Hayes are a good team, but Hunt, like most of Wayne's leading ladies in these Monogram productions, has zero charisma and absolutely no chemistry with Wayne.
