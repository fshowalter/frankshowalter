Synopsis: A man (William Holden) marries a woman (Frances Dee) from a rich family, then discovers she can’t live within a budget.

Meet the Stewarts is a surprisingly funny film.  Instead of trying for laughs through physical comedy or grating situations (both pretty standard for comedies of the time), Meet the Stewarts instead offers up a script with some pretty good lines.

It doesn’t hurt that Frances Dee has a faint echo of Rosalind Russell, in that she has a certain toughness about her that prevents her from seeming too coy, especially in her scenes opposite William Holden. 

And it’s Holden that really anchors the film.  He makes a fantastic straight man who comes across as both likable and relatable, and his character’s willingness to stand up (or at least try) to Frances Dee’s is a refreshing change.

Adding to this is the film’s brief 73 minute running time, which keeps it from wearing out its welcome. 

Bottom Line: While it’s no classic, Meet the Stewarts is funnier than it has any right to be.
