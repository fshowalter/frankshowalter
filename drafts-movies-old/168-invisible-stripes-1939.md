Raft plays a parolee trying to make a fresh start but keeps running up against the stigma of being an ex-con. When he sees younger brother Holden heading down the same path that landed him behind bars, Raft joins up with gangster Bogart to secretly finance Holden's dream of owning his own garage. The mantra of "show, don't tell" is lost on the filmmakers, as the characters repeatedly verbalize every plot point, making this a very trying 81 minutes, despite the solid cast.
