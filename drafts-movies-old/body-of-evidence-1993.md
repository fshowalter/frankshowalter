Synopsis: A married attorney (Willem Dafoe) finds himself drawn to his client (Madonna), a woman charged with murdering her husband through sex.

Body of Evidence is an anemic Basic Instinct (1992) clone that tries too hard to be thrilling and mysterious and instead comes across as recycled and muddled. This, despite a solid cast including Julianne Moore, Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer, Joe Mantegna and Madonna. 

Brad Mirman's script reads like bad pulp fiction, which wouldn't be so much of a problem if director Uli Edel and the cast weren't taking it so seriously. It's one thing to glorify trash for trash's sake, ala Grindhouse (2007), but Edel and company are peddling trash masquerading as real drama. 

Worse still, they're wasting a great cast. Julianne Moore is regulated to a one-dimensional part with little screen time and Joe Mantegna's role couldn't get more stereotypical. Ironically, Madonna, who has the least big screen experience, seems to be only cast member clued in to the material's cheesy nature, as her performances waffles between earnest and over-the-top. Granted, the result is still a disaster, but at least there are moments when it seems like she gets it.

That said, in the right frame of mind, Body of Evidence could easily be enjoyed in a "so bad it's good" sense. The production values and convoluted story do manage to hold your interest. Mix in some drinks and a crowd with a similar mindset and you've got a good time. Just don't go in expecting anything more.
