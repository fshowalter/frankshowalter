Johnson is a Navy officer who relieves Bogart of duty in a typhoon, leading to a court martial where he's defended by Ferrer. Bogart's great as the paranoid Captain Queeg (great name), and it's his performance, along with the equally fantastic supporting cast, that makes the movie work, despite an  overlong, uneven script that includes a series of subplots concerning Robert Francis' family and girlfriend that don't go anywhere.
