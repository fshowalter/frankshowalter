Wayne plays a sea captain who, as the film opens, is unconscious, having been knocked out by a treacherous first mate who's been paid to scuttle the ship by an underhanded salvager, played by Raymond Massey. 

Wayne is saved by Scarlett O'Hara-clone Goddard and the two fall in love, but things get complicated when a foppish lawyer, played by Milland, enters the picture. Milland falls for Goddard too and soon Wayne's making a deal with the devil in the form of Massey, planning to scuttle his dream ship in return for enough money to ensure he and Goddard can live a good life together. Things don't go as planned, however, and Wayne finds himself on trial for deliberately wrecking the vessel. 

Then Wayne and Milland fight a giant squid.

Shot in technicolor and featuring set pieces packed with the then-pinnacle of special effects, DeMille spared no expense in this, his answer to _Gone with the Wind_.

But all the gloss can't distract from the wealth of lines characters deliver while gazing at nothing in particular, nor from the script that somehow goes from a court room sequence to the prosecutor and defendant diving for evidence. Wayne and Lynne Overman, who plays Goddard's old salt skipper, are the lone bright spots in a dull mess of a movie that's only notable today as one of the few instances where Wayne plays a bad guy. Or, at least, a good guy gone bad.
