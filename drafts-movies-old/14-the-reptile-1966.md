A remix of Hammer's earlier flick, The Gorgon (1964), with Gilling getting a lot of atmospheric milage out of the limited budget and head-scratcher script by Hammer producer Anthony Hinds. De-facto protagonists Daniel and Barrett are workable, and Michael Ripper shines as the local pub owner who--against type--comes to the aid of the new couple in town. The creature effects show their age, but the bite effects hold up well. There really isn't enough foaming-at-mouth in today's films.
