Synopsis: A newspaper editor (Humphrey Bogart) fights to save his paper, reunite with his ex-wife, and bring down a mobster.

Deadline – U.S.A. is an underrated gem. Humphrey Bogart and Ethel Barrymore lead a great cast backed by a solid script full of great dialog.

At only 87 minutes, Deadline – U.S.A. moves through a lot of plot at a very brisk pace, but does so in a way that perfectly mirrors the frantic, controlled chaos of a big-city newsroom. Indeed, the only character that somewhat falls by the wayside is Kim Hunter as Bogart’s ex-wife, but again, this mirrors the reality the story is trying to cultivate.

Granted, by the end the importance and influence of a single newspaper is stretched a bit thin, but the movie’s so damn entertaining it’s hard to notice.

Bottom Line: A great little movie that deserves more recognition.  Recommended.
