Synopsis: A reporter (Wayne Morris) and a doctor uncover the secret behind a resurrected criminal with a need for blood (Humphrey Bogart).

The Return of Doctor X is notable chiefly as one of Humphrey Bogart's most ridiculous roles. He plays a diabolical doctor turned pasty white, blood-hungry zombie complete with heavy makeup, lipstick, glasses, and a white streak down the center of his hair. It's a ludicrous getup that's almost guaranteed to incite a laugh when he finally makes his big entrance. Did I mention that he's also cradeling a blood-hungry zombie rabbit during said big entrance? Yeah, it's that insane. 

Unfortunately, you've got to endure a lot to get there. Even watching it for the camp value, The Return of Doctor X is a bore, as Bogart doesn't make his entrance until the film is almost a quarter of the way through. It's well-known that Bogart didn't want to play the role (it's rumored that Boris Karloff was the first choice) but to add insult to injury, despite playing the title character, he only gets third billing behind Rosemary Lane, who's hardly in the film at all. Prepare to make liberal use of that fast-forward button here, folks, cause this one's a doozy. 

Finally, for those movie buffs out there wondering if this is a sequel to the Michael Curtiz directed Doctor X (1932), it's not. The "return" in the title refers to a plot point concerning Bogie's character, though it's certainly misleading.
