Private eye Bogart, hired to investigate a simple blackmail ploy, runs into a series of murders as he falls for Bacall, his client's somewhat-bad-girl daughter who knows more than she's letting on. Hawk's original cut, shown overseas to American servicemen but never released theatrically, is a good first draft. The cast is perfect, but there's a lot of fat, like the scene of Bogart searching Geiger's apartment and the very talky plot recap in the DA's office after Bogart snares Lundgren, and the decision to dress Bacall in veil for one of her few scenes with Bogart is a head scratcher. Watch the theatrical print instead.
