On assignment to Europe, American reporter McCrea uncovers a conspiracy on the eve of World War II. Hitchcock's in fine form, steaming through the serpentine plot while delivering one memorable sequence after another, from the surprisingly bloody assassination and the ensuing escape through a crowd of umbrellas to the amazing plane crash effect that Robert Zemeckis aped for _Cast Away (2000)_. Though Hitch originally wanted Gary Cooper, McCrea is more than capable as an everyman thrust into a huge conspiracy. George Sanders is great in a very charismatic supporting turn, and Herbert Marshall does a fine job of taking a role that screams Claude Rains and making it his own. Recommended.
