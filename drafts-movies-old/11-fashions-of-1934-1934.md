A light snack of a movie buoyed by the considerable charisma of stars  Powell, Davis, and McHugh as fashion pirates whose schemes take them from New York to Paris. Powell carries the film as a lovable cad, showcasing the urbane charm and light comedic timing that would become his trademarks while McHugh handles the more overt comedy. Davis doesn't have much to do, but she looks great doing it. 

The script keeps things moving along at a lighthearted pace, and the musical numbers are visually engaging and mercifully short, making for a breezy 78 minutes.
