Synopsis: A British scientist (Peter Cushing) sets out with an American (Forrest Tucker) on an expedition up the Himalayas in search of the elusive yeti.

The Abominable Snowman is a decent little monster movie from Hammer Film Productions that makes the most of its meager budget and works thanks in large part to stars Peter Cushing and Forrest Tucker.

The script by Nigel Kneale works as more of a psychological horror, which is to the film's advantage, as it minimizes the need to show the actual creature. Kneale treats the creature as more of a phantom, and relies on the desolate surroundings and brutal environments to serve as the tangible menace as he ratchets up the tension. Director Val Guest picks up on this perfectly and stretches his small budget to the limit, creating a believable mountain atmosphere despite the sometimes obvious studio settings.

But that's only possible thanks to the strong performances by Peter Cushing and Forrest Tucker. Their charismatic turns keep you focused on the characters and go a long way toward distracting you from the studio sets and weak special effects. 

In the end, The Abominable Snowman won't win any awards, but for fans of the monster movie genre, or Hammer Film Productions, it's a reasonable way to pass an hour and a half.
