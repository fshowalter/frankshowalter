Wealthy businessman Grant proposes an affair to virtuous secretary Day who is more interested in marriage. It's an  agreeable, if forgettable, romantic comedy that downplays Day's usual screwball antics and coasts along on Grant and Day's charm. Supporting them, Gig Young is great as Grant’s would-be conscience and Audrey Meadows steals all of her scenes as Day’s overprotective roommate. Director Mann's decision to film Day in soft focus was overkill though, as she still looked great at 38 and at that age was quite believable as a romantic interest for Grant, who was 58.
