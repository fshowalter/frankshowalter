Wayne plays an undercover federal marshal who solves the mystery of the feared outlaw known only as “The Shadow.” Bradbury's Scooby-Doo mystery script works better than it should, with the stunts and fight scenes belying the film’s shoestring budget, and casting of Yakima Canutt as, Yak, Wayne’s Tonto-esque sidekick, good for a few chuckles.
