Synopsis: In Hong Kong, a Eurasian doctor (Jennifer Jones) falls for a married war correspondent (William Holden) during the Communist Revolution.

Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing is a very well produced melodrama highlighted by a good performance from William Holden.

Holden is his usual charismatic self, slipping into the role of a war-weary correspondent with an eye for the ladies with ease.  He charms the audience from the outset and carries the film when he’s on-screen.

Opposite him, Jennifer Jones is less engaging.  She doesn’t look Eurasian, she has zero chemistry with Holden, and she never really wins over the audience.  As a result, their entire romance feels forced, as you’re never quite sure what Holden’s character sees in her.  Compounding this is the fact that, despite the billing, this is really Jones' movie, and as a result, it drags whenever Holden’s off-screen.

Casting misstep aside, Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing has some great production values. The beautiful, wide-screen, location photography does a great job of establishing atmosphere, as do the sets and costumes.  This is a movie that looks <em>very</em> good, and it’s a shame the story isn’t better able to take advantage.

Bottom Line: A wonderfully produced melodrama with a good performance by William Holden brought down by a weak performance from Jennifer Jones.
