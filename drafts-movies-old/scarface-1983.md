Synopsis: A Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) rises to the top of Miami’s drug world in the early 80s.

Scarface is one of those rare remakes that manages to capture the spirit of the original and improve on it in nearly every way.  Screenwriter Oliver Stone transplants Ben Hecht’s story to Miami and sets the title character’s rise in the underworld as a scathing condemnation of America’s consumerist culture.

Director Brian DePalma handles the action with style.  Though the movie dates itself at every turn, DePalma makes the most of it, using the fashions and styles of the greed-is-good decade as another lead performer.

Capping the film though, is Pacino.  His performance as Tony Montana is mesmerizing. He struts through the film practically dripping testosterone and manages to get audiences rooting for him even as they’re repulsed by his actions.

Unfortunately Pacino is so good, the rest of the cast pales in comparison, particularly Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the crucial part of Montana’s sister. While Pacino’s mania works, Mastrantonio seems over the top, a slight blemish on a great picture.

Bottom Line: An epic gangster picture that’s really something more.  Highly recommended.
