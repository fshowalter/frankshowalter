Hurt plays a scientist in the year 2031 whose latest creation, an ultimate weapon for the military, inadvertently creates a hole in time that transports him and his futuristic car to 1817's Switzerland where he meets Mary Godwin and learns that Victor Frankenstein and his monster are very much real. It's an interesting premise and Hurt and Julia are capable as the leads, but the meat of the story is far too predictable and the monster effects are borderline laughable.
