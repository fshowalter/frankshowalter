Campbell and four friends head out to a deserted cabin in the woods where they inadvertently release an ancient evil. Raimi's cult-classic isn't much on story or characterization, but more than makes up for it with creative visuals, inventive special effects, a star-in-the-making performance from Campbell, and raw enthusiasm.
