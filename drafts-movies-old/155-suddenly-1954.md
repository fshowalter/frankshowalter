Assassin for hire Sinatra and his gang hold a family and sheriff Hayden hostage as they wait for the President to get off the train at the station next door, so Sinatra can shoot him. Clocking in at a lean 75 minutes, Sale's script operates in near real-time, ratcheting up the pressure while avoiding a myriad of clich√©s as Sinatra goes from cool and collected to near raving mad in a fearless performance that makes you wish he'd played more villains. Recommended.
