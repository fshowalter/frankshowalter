Huston's ambitious but flawed adaptation of Malcolm Lowry's novel follows the end of Finney, in a tour-de-force performance as a former vice consul for the British government in Mexico, who's fallen to the depths of alcoholism. From the opening scene onward, Huston builds an ever-increasing sense of doom and despair that mirrors Finney's character's condition. It's the Day of the Dead on the eve of World War II, Finney's estranged ex-wife, played by Bisset, has returned, as has his half-brother, with whom she had an affair before leaving, and over them all, the volcano looms. 

Admittedly, it takes a while to get going, and some of the plot threads don't seem to pay off, but once Huston sets Finney in motion toward his inevitable, horrific end the film's sense of dread is almost palpable.

It's easy to see why Huston was attracted to the material, as he'd explored similar themes of desperation and addiction in films like The Night of the Iguana (1964) and Fat City (1972), although, perhaps reading too much into it, you could say Huston, at 78, identified most with the story of a man grappling with his own impending end.
