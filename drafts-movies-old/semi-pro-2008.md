Synopsis: After learning that only the top four teams will be absorbed in the coming merger with the NBA, an ABA owner-coach-player (Will Ferrell) rallies his team to make the cut.

Semi-Pro is a Will Ferrell movie in the mold of <a href= "/browse/reviews/anchorman-the-legend-of-ron-burgundy-2004/">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a>, <a href="/browse/reviews/talladega-nights-the-ballad-of-ricky-bobby-2006/">Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</a>, or Blades of Glory.  That said, if you liked those film’s you’ll certainly enjoy Semi Pro, which, while it’s not quite as good the two former films, is certainly better than the latter.

Ferrell does his usual man-child act, but fortunately doesn’t have to carry the movie on his own.  Woody Harrelson, André Benjamin, and Maura Tierney round out a solid supporting cast that keeps things moving well enough when Ferrell’s off screen, and Will Arnett and Andrew Daly deserve special mention as a dynamite team of commentators, with Daly playing a perfect straight-man to both Arnett and Ferrell.

Indeed, Semi-Pro’s weakest link lies in first time director Kent Alterman.  While it’s clear the dark, muted photography was meant as an homage to 70’s filmmaking, it ends up giving the film a cheap, drab feel that’s out of place in a comedy such as this.  Further, the film does drag a bit at times, a problem a few minutes of editing could easily have resolved.

Bottom Line: While not his greatest work, fans of Will Ferrell should enjoy Semi-Pro, provided they’re not looking for anything too original.
