A sprawling frontier adventure with Douglas and Martin as rivals turned buddies who join a keelboat expedition up the Missouri River through Indian country. It's textbook Hawks, mixing gritty, realistic details about the job at hand with an idealistic version of male camaraderie, all the while framed against a seemingly overwhelming enemy and topped off with a colorful character actor, in this case Arthur Hunnicutt. Sure, Douglas steals all his scenes, and Hawks' "discovery" Threatt is less than memorable, but Hawks' formula works and holds your interest. You only wish he'd made this a few years later, as the Wyoming locations deserve the extra screen space Cinemascope would have given them.
