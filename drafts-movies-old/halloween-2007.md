Synopsis: Seventeen years to the day after murdering most of his family, Michael Myers escapes his institutional confines to return home.

Rob Zombie’s remake of John Carpenter’s Halloween is a frustrating thing that veers between very good and downright boring.

The first quarter of the movie deals with a ten-year-old Michael, who exhibits all the classic early warning signs of a serial killer.  This, combined with an abusive, unstable home life churn and build until the young boy erupts in a fit of eerily calm rage.  On its own, this section of the movie works very well.  Zombie takes us inside the head and life of the young boy, painting him not as a monster, but as a very troubled child. 

Then young Michael is institutionalized and the movie starts to drag.  We see Michael interacting with Malcolm McDowell’s Dr. Loomis.  See him visiting with his mother.  More with Dr. Loomis.  This section culminates in another bit of violence, but adds nothing to the character and does nothing to advance the story.  It’s really little more than a bridge to the next part of the film.

Fast-forward seventeen years.  It’s Halloween night and a now full grown (and massive) Michael escapes the institution as Zombie begins a compressed remake of Carpenter’s original film.  Zombie abandons the careful deconstruction of the serial killer persona and abruptly shifts the focus to a group of teenage girls.  Unfortunately, in deconstructing Myers, Zombie removed all the ambiguities that made Carpenters original work so effective.

For example, while Zombie goes through great pains to show the circumstances that created Myers, Carpenter let us believe that it could happen anywhere, even in a seemingly perfect home.  In effect, Zombie’s humanizing of the character doesn’t mesh with the indestructible super-human killing machine we see in the last half of the film.  Myers isn’t evil personified; he’s a sick man.

Bottom Line: The first half an hour works very well, but after that things go downhill fast.
