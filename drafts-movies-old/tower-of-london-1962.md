Synopsis: Richard III (Vincent Price) grows madder and madder as he murders his way to the throne of England.

Tower of London is a rather decent remake of the 1939 film of the same name.  While director Roger Corman had originally planned to shoot the film in color, the sharp black and white photography ends up giving the film a nice retro feel and helps the special effects.

Vincent Price is good as Richard of Gloucester, especially in the first half where he’s wonderfully wicked before descending into complete madness.  Indeed, the first half of his performance brings to mind his role in the great Witchfinder General (1968).

Unfortunately, as the film progresses Price’s character gradually loses his edge as he slides from wicked to crazy.  However, the film's brief 79 minute running time prevents it from wearing out its welcome and somewhat mitigates the weaker third act.

Bottom Line: A solid movie that should entertain both Vincent Price fans and fans of the genre.
