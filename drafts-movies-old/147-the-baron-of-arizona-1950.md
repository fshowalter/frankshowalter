Former office clerk Price devotes years of his life to forging a Spanish land grant giving his wife claim to the entire state of Arizona. Interesting mix of western locales, noir themes and historical mystery that works thanks to a great performance from Price who runs the gamut from warm charm to cold indifference and finally megalomaniacal insanity, and a cogent script from Fuller that avoids any genre trappings.
