Synopsis: An amiable man (James Stewart) has a friend only he can see: a six foot three inch talking rabbit named Harvey.

Harvey is a charming movie with a rough beginning.  Josephine Hull overacts and everyone behaves like a caricature, but the second James Stewart makes his entrance you realize why this movie is considered a classic.  His performance is so easy and natural, you're instantly charmed just like the characters in the film.  Now don't get me wrong, I realize the point of the opening sequence it to contrast the supposedly "sane" people with Stewart's supposedly "crazy" character, but it's still over the top and off-putting.

That aside, the movie only gets better, leading up to a note-perfect ending that can't help but leave you with a smile.

Bottom Line: An enchanting ride with a rocky start.  Recommended.
