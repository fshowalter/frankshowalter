Quarry plays the suave Yorga, a European expatriate vampire quietly stocking his undead harem in 1970's Los Angeles until a doctor, played by Perry, realizes what's going on. 

Kelljan's resetting of the Dracula mythos in modern times is better than it has any right to be, especially considering that it began life as a soft-core porn. Some of the erotic elements remain though, and only add to the film’s bizarre charm. Walking around in a ridiculously theatrical wardrobe and cape, Quarry looks laughably out of place, yet he exudes real menace, particularly during his pre-dawn "discussion" with Perry. While Kelljan's script can be a bit talky at times, the opening sequence showing a coffin being unloaded from an ocean liner and driven up a highway is an excellent example of less-is-more, and the notorious cat sequence still packs a punch. Note that the aforementioned cat sequence only seems to be present on prints bearing the title “The Loves of Count Iorga, Vampire” (the ‘I’ isn’t a typo).

Though it's certainly cheap and even cheesy at times, Kelljan's film proved to be hugely influential, and not just in film, but literature as well, as it's hard to imagine Stephen King not having seen this before writing 'Salem's Lot.
