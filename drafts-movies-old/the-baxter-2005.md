Synopsis: A quintessential nice-guy (Michael Showalter), constantly upstaged by his girlfriend’s exes, finds himself finally about to be married.

The Baxter is an entertaining comedy, especially through the first half.  Writer, director, and star Michael Showalter tells his story well enough, but gets bogged down by plot in the second half.

The other problem is that Michelle Williams’s character is instantly more charming and likeable than Elizabeth Banks’s, thus making it hard to empathize with Michael Showalter’s character.

Those problems aside, the movie has its moments, and is easily enjoyable enough to keep you from feeling burned.

Bottom Line: A pleasant surprise worth catching on cable.
