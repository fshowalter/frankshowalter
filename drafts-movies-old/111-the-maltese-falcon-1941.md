Though edgy for it's time, Huston's ground-breaking film-noir plays better now as a black comedy, with tough-guy private eye Bogart drawn into Astor's desperate search for a jeweled statue after his partner is shot. It's a great ride, with Bogart, Peter Lorre and Syndey Greenstreet all relishing Huston's razor-sharp dialog in genre-defining performances, and Huston, in his directorial debut, propelling the story along at a breakneck pace.
