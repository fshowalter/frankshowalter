Karloff's great as a pragmatic, life-long soldier struggling to fight an enemy he can't shoot or stab, but the talky script gives us little reason to root for its would-be protagonists Cramer and Drew, both of whom comes across as self-absorbed and stubborn--dangerous qualities when dealing with a health crisis. 

*However*, if you consider Karloff the protagonist, then the story becomes something of a horrific tragedy. The contrived plot becomes "the hand of fate" and Drew becomes a villain whose headstrong, selfish behavior nearly costs everyone their lives. Not what the filmmakers had in mind, but it works.
