A breakdown of the reviews:

<table>
<caption>Reviews by Decade of Film Release</caption>
<thead>
<th>Decade</th>
<th># of Reviews</th>

<td>1930's</td>
<td>3</td>

<tr>
<td>1940's</td>

A surprisingly strong showing for the 1960's, but no love for the 1930's or 1990's.

<table>
<caption>Reviews by Grade</caption>
<thead>
<th>Grade</th>
<th># of Reviews</th>
<tr>
<td>A's</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D's</td>

No F's so far, but an unusually large number of A's. 

Finally, according to my logs, the most popular review so far is <a href="/browse/reviews/the-simpsons-movie-2007/">The Simpsons Movie (2007)</a>.
